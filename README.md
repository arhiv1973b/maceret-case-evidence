# Apostille Archive Commentary

This archive is not merely a technical repository of PDF files, nor is it a private collection of court decisions.

It is a structured array of documents authenticated with an apostille—that is, confirmed by a mechanism operating within the system established under the Hague Conference on Private International Law.

The apostille certifies the authenticity of a signature and the status of an official. It does not certify the legality of the content of a judicial act.

This distinction is central to understanding the purpose of the archive.

## Purpose of Publishing the Archive

The archive was created to:

1. Establish the chronology of judicial decisions.
2. Demonstrate procedural inconsistencies.
3. Analyze recurring structural patterns.
4. Identify signs of institutional impunity.
5. Support cascade judicial rehabilitation.

This is not about the fate of a single individual, but about examining how the system responds to allegations of torture and serious violations.

## Connection to Article 17 of the Rome Statute

Article 17 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court establishes the principle of complementarity.

The essence of the provision:

International jurisdiction is activated if the state:

- is unwilling to carry out a genuine investigation, or
- is objectively unable to do so.

The archive allows the reader to pose the question independently:

Is a genuine investigation taking place into allegations of torture?
Or is there formal proceedings simulating judicial activity?

If decisions systematically avoid analyzing allegations of torture, while creating the appearance of procedural completion, a problem of compliance with Article 17 criteria arises.

## What Is Offered to the Reader

The archive is open for independent analysis.

Readers are invited to:

- cross-reference decision dates with apostille dates,
- check for repetition of formulations,
- compare the content of the reasoning sections,
- determine whether allegations of torture are examined on their merits,
- note identical procedural constructs in different cases.

If a persistent pattern emerges where:

- complaints are dismissed without examination of evidence,
- no effective verification is conducted,
- medical or procedural materials are not assessed,

this is not a private error but a systemic problem.

## The Question of Institutional Impunity

International law regards the prohibition of torture as a jus cogens norm—an imperative norm from which no derogation is permitted.

The obligation to investigate such acts is of an erga omnes character—a duty owed to the international community as a whole.

If the state mechanism:

- formally issues judicial acts,
- authenticates them with an apostille,
- but does not conduct effective investigations,

a conflict between form and content arises.

## The Archive as a Tool for Verification, Not Accusation

The purpose of the archive is not accusatory rhetoric.

The purpose is to provide verifiable data:

- official documents,
- authenticated by apostille,
- with preserved digital integrity,
- enabling cross-referencing.

Each reader can independently determine:

whether the presented body of documents is an example of a functioning justice system
or an example of justice simulation while maintaining formal procedural shell.

## Cascade Judicial Rehabilitation

The concept of cascade rehabilitation means:

if the primary violation (e.g., torture) is not investigated,
all subsequent procedural decisions based on that violation are subject to review.

Rehabilitation cannot be partial if the foundation of the case has not been removed.

## Conclusion

This archive is a tool for analysis.

It does not automatically prove the existence of a crime.
It shows the structure of decisions.

And poses the key question предусмотренный статьёй 17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court:

whether a genuine investigation was carried out
or whether there was justice simulation.

The answer to this question defines the boundary between state domestic jurisdiction and international responsibility.
