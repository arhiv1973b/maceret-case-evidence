Subject: URGENT STORY LEAD: Digital Evidence Vault vs. State Fraud - Jus Cogens Precedent

Dear Investigative Team,

I am reaching out with a unique investigative story regarding a digital "Evidence Vault" built to challenge decades of state-led corruption and identity theft in Moldova.

This is not just a human rights case - it is a technological and legal precedent. Following the "Jus Cogens" doctrine, we have bypassed the compromised local judiciary by creating an immutable GitHub registry of evidence.

KEY HOOKS:
- THE US CONNECTION: Official monitoring by the White House (latest confirmation Feb 21, 2026)
- IDENTITY SABOTAGE: Forensic proof of state-led linguistic fraud used to strip property rights
- DIGITAL INTEGRITY: 246+ files secured with SHA-256 hashes - a "Digital Tribunal" in action

Evidence Repository & Investigative Roadmap: https://github.com/arhiv1973b/maceret-case-evidence/tree/REVOLUTION-JUS-COGENS-V1

I am available for a remote interview.

NOTICE: This communication is registered in the immutable GitHub registry. Failure to act will be documented.
