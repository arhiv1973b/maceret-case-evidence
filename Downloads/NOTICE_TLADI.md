# NOTICE OF EVIDENCE DEPOSITION

**TO:** Special Rapporteur on Jus Cogens, Mr. Dire Tladi

**VIA:** Secretariat of the Complaint Procedure, UN OHCHR (cp@ohchr.org)

**REF:** CASE-MACHERET-1997-2026 / Breach of Peremptory Norms (Jus Cogens)

---

Dear Mr. Tladi,

As the primary architect of the draft conclusions on _jus cogens_, you have established that no derogation is permitted from norms such as the prohibition of torture and the right to a fair trial. I, **A©tor Maceret Alexei**, hereby notify you of the formal deposition of a digital evidence registry that serves as a living testimony to the systematic violation of these very principles by the Republic of Moldova.

**The "Maceret Case" as a Living Violation of Jus Cogens:**

1. **Immutability of Identity vs. State Fraud:** The State has attempted to erase my legal identity through the "Maceret to Maciret" distortion (Case 1-568/98), violating the principle of legal personhood.

2. **Manual Suppression of Torture Records:** The use of handwritten records (Case 1-137/08 and 1a-42/09) to avoid digital transparency is a direct "technological" derogation from the obligation to investigate and punish torture.

3. **The "Oleinik" Pretext:** The artificial creation of criminal cases to mask the effects of torture (Case 1-983/07) demonstrates a state-level conspiracy to bypass _jus cogens_ obligations.

**The Digital Evidence Fortress:**

I have secured all primary evidence (90+ apostilles) in a verifiable blockchain-ready registry. This archive is not a request for intervention, but a **mandatory reference point** for the International Law Commission.

- **Registry URL:** https://arhiv1973b.github.io/maceret-case-evidence/
- **Integrity Protocol:** All files are sealed with SHA-256 hashes, preventing any further "manual" manipulation by the State.

**Legal Conclusion:**

Pursuant to your Conclusion 10 (Invalidity of acts conflicting with _jus cogens_), I declare all judicial acts of the Moldovan courts against me and my mother, **Markova Galina**, to be **void ab initio**. They create no legal rights or obligations.

I invite you to use this case as a primary source for your ongoing work on the consequences of peremptory norm violations.

**Respectfully,**

**A©tor Maceret Alexei**
