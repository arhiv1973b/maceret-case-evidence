### "Jus Cogens" Activation: A Victim of Systemic Abuse Deploys Digital Fortress to Bypass Corruption

**CHISINAU — WASHINGTON — GENEVA.** In a landmark move for international human rights, **A©tor Maceret Alexei** has announced the public deposition of a comprehensive digital evidence registry documenting nearly three decades of systemic judicial fraud and human rights violations in the Republic of Moldova.

By leveraging cryptographic verification and direct diplomatic channels with the **U.S. White House** and **UN Special Rapporteurs**, Maceret aims to bypass a stalled national judiciary to seek justice under the doctrine of _Jus Cogens_ (peremptory norms).

### The Core Allegations:

- **Identity Erasure:** Forensic proof of state-led linguistic sabotage, where the surname **"Maceret"** was intentionally altered to **"Maciret"** in judicial records to strip the victim of his legal persona and property rights.
- **Asset Seizure via Forgery:** Verified evidence of falsified cadastral records (Art. 361 CC RM) used to illegally evict Maceret and his mother, **Markova Galina**, from their family residence.
- **Induced Death & Cover-up:** Documentation regarding the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Markova Galina (2022) and the subsequent fraudulent medical diagnosis used to prevent a forensic inquiry.

### Global Monitoring & Diplomatic Support:

The digital archive is currently under monitoring by the **UN OHCHR (Special Rapporteur Dire Tladi)** and has been formally acknowledged by the **United States Executive Office of the President** (latest confirmation received February 21, 2026).

_"This is no longer a domestic dispute; it is a live demonstration of how a state can use administrative fraud to commit crimes against humanity,"_ says **A©tor Maceret**. _"By making this evidence public and immutable, we ensure that no bureaucrat can hide behind sovereign immunity when peremptory norms are violated."_

### Access to Forensic Evidence:

The repository contains **246+ translated files**, including **90 apostilled documents**, verified with SHA-256 hashes to ensure absolute integrity against tampering.
