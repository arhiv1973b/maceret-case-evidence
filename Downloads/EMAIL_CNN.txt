Subject: STORY LEAD: Digital Evidence Vault vs. Moldova State Fraud - US White House Monitored Case

Dear Investigative Team,

I am presenting a landmark case: a digital "Evidence Vault" documenting decades of state-led fraud and human rights violations in Moldova, now under monitoring by the US White House.

KEY POINTS:
- Evidence of cadastral forgery (Art. 361 CC RM)
- Identity theft ("Maceret" → "Maciret") 
- 246+ files secured with cryptographic hashes

Latest White House protocol: February 21, 2026

Repository & Roadmap: https://github.com/arhiv1973b/maceret-case-evidence/tree/REVOLUTION-JUS-COGENS-V1

Available for interview.
