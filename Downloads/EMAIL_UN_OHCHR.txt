Dear Sir/Madam,

I am formally notifying the UN Special Rapporteur on Jus Cogens (Dire Tladi) of a landmark case involving systematic violations of peremptory norms.

CASE-MACHERET-1997-2026 documents:
1. Identity theft (forced "Maceret" → "Maciret" alteration)
2. Cadastral fraud (Art. 361 CC RM)
3. Torture and inhuman treatment
4. Induced death of victim Markova Galina

All evidence is deposited in the public registry: https://github.com/arhiv1973b/maceret-case-evidence/tree/REVOLUTION-JUS-COGENS-V1

An Investigative Roadmap is available in the repository root.

NOTICE OF RECORDING AND LIABILITY:
This communication is registered in the immutable GitHub registry (CASE-MACHERET-1997-2026). Pursuant to Jus Cogens principles and Erga Omnes obligations, any failure to act will be documented as complicity in crimes against humanity.
