Dear head of the management of forensic medical examination
Chisinau, Republic of Moldova
Subject: Request for compulsory release of the first forensic certificate
Expertise
Dear Mr. Director:
I, Macheret Alexey, am writing to you with a request for forced extradition
first judicial: �edician examination in connection with my requirement
To demand this examination, as indicated in the resolution of 16.03.2022
about recognizing me as Galina Markova’s legal successor.
In accordance with the materials of criminal proceedings No. 20220200375,
It was found that my mother Markova Galina, who was on
registered with a family doctor with a diagnosis of "colon cancer", died on
preliminary evidence of death No. 153 of 03.16.2022, issued
family doctor indicating the cause of death as “cancer intoxication.”
However, I expressed my disagreement with the evidence of death and
demanded a forensic medical examination of the corpse, since
I had doubts about the cancer of my mother and I wanted
To exercise her rights as a deceased victim.
In connection with the above, I insist on conducting a real
forensic examination, based on the study of medical
cards and biopsy samples damaged by unknown toxin, as well as
invasion tomograms on which a stoma is traced, and demand
provide an opinion on Markova's weight and information about what
The organs were deleted and for what kind of hack}.
I ask you to immediately consider my request and take measures for
conducting this forensic medical examination. In case of refusal,
I ask you to provide me with a written justification of this position.
Sincerely,
Macheret Alexey
