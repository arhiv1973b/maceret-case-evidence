8th International Forum on the e -APP  
17-18 October 2013 – Montevideo, Uruguay  
CONCLUSIONS & RECOMM ENDATIONS  
Over 90 experts from 31 States and  an international organisation1 convened in Montevideo, 
Uruguay to attend the 8th International Forum on the elect ronic Apostille Program (e -APP) . 
The Forum was held under the auspices of the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay  and 
organised in collaboration with the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private 
International Law  and its Latin American Region al Office in Buenos Aires (Argentina) . 
The participants expressed their gratitude to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay for 
generously hosting the event – the first Forum to be held in Latin America and the Southern 
Hemisphere – and were honoured b y the presence of the Vice -Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Uruguay, His Excellency Luis Porto , who opened the event with the Secretary General of the 
Hague Conference on Private International Law , Mr Christophe Bernasconi.   
The participants acknowledged that the Montevideo Forum provided an excellent opportunity 
for the exchange of information about the implementation and latest developments of the e -APP, 
allowing States to learn from the experience of a growing number of e -APP jurisdictions. This 
Forum  succeeded in bringing together  almost all  Latin American States , all of which are either 
Contracting States to the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of 
Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents  (Apostille Convention ) or actively con sidering 
accession . In addition,  participants welcomed the presence  of States from regions that are 
currently under -represente d among Contracting States  to the Convention , such as the Middle 
East and Southern  Africa , which reaffir ms the fact th at the inter est in Apostille Convention and  
the e -APP continues to grow in all regions of the world.  
The participants encouraged all national institutions of the Contracting States from the private 
and public sectors to commit to the successful development of the proc ess. 
Participants also recalled that the Apostille Convention has been shown to assist States in 
establishing conditions more amenable to foreign investment and international trade. In 
particular, the participants noted with interest the 2010 Report of the  International Finance 
Corporation of the World Bank  Group  entitled Investing Across Border s, which surveys foreign 
direct investment regulation across 87  economies and which acknowledges the positive impact 
of the Apostille Convention on the ability of foreign companies to set up and conduct business.  
The participants unanimously reached the following conclusions and made the following 
recommendations : 
                                                 
1 Andorra, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, China (Hong Kong SAR), Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, Korea (Republic of), Mexico, Namibia, New  Zealand, Nicaragua, 
Paraguay, Peru, Portuga l, Qatar , Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland (incl. Bermuda), United States of America, Uruguay, and a representative from 
INTERPOL . 
2 The electronic Apostille Program ( e-APP ) in general   
1. The p articipants congratulated the many Competent A uthorities – now numbering over 
160 from  18 Contracting States  – that have already implemented one or both components of the 
e-APP.2 They particularly welcomed the jurisdictions that h ave joined the e -APP since the 
7th International Forum on the e -APP (held in Izmir from 14 to 15 June 2012 , hereinafter “Izmir 
Forum ”), namely Ireland , Nicaragua, Slovenia (11 District Courts) and  Uruguay . In addition, 
participants applauded the efforts of several States and jurisdictions in actively pursuing 
implementation of  one or both components of the e -APP.  Participants also noted with interest 
that new Contracting States are increasingly taking the e -APP into account in their efforts to 
join the Convention.  Participants welcomed the  announcement of  the United Kingdom  
regarding the launch of its e-Register planned for  the end of October 2013 , the announcement  of 
the Republic of Moldova regarding the issuance of e-Apostilles from  1 October 2013, as well as 
the announcement  of Nicaragua concerning the launch of its e-Registe r of Apostilles in May 
2013.  
2. Participants welcomed the  publication of the Handbook on the Practical Operation of the 
Apostille Convention (Apostille Handbook ) published in  April 2013,  including , Chapter 6 which 
addresses the e -APP.  
3. Participants further noted with satisfaction  the support of the 201 2 meeting of the Special 
Commission on the Practical Operat ion of the Apostille Convention , which “reco gnise [d] the 
value of the e -APP a s a tool to further secure and effective operation of the Apostille 
Conventi on and note [d] with satisfaction the continued implementation of the e -APP and the 
expanding use of e -Apostilles and e -Registers”.  
4. Participants further noted that t he total number of e -Apostilles issued by Competent 
Authorities around the world since the s tart of the e -APP keeps increasing . 
5. Participants encouraged all Contracting States to the Apostille Convention to actively 
consider implementing the e -APP. Participants also encouraged Competent Authorities that are 
interested in implementing either or bot h component s of the e -APP to consult with other 
Competent Authorities that have already implemented the relevant component (s). Participants 
recognised the benefits of establishing a dialogue between Competent Authorities  with regard to 
the implementation o f the e -APP, which will facilitate the develop ment  of good practices and 
enhance awareness among State authorities of the different e-APP systems in operatio n around 
the world  
Implementation  of the  Apostille Convention and the  e-APP in Uruguay  
6. Participants  congratulated the relevant Uruguayan authorities on the first anniversary of 
the accession of Uruguay to the Convention and expected a promising future with the 
development and implementation of a Category 2 e -Register. Uruguay has made great efforts to 
implement the Apostille Convention  and is in the beginnings of the process of decentralising  the 
service of its Competent Authority with a view to favouring inclusion and social integration of 
all its citizens. At the same time, work is currently being carr ied out towards the implementation 
of the e -Apostille component, which is a key element of Uruguay’s plans in relation to its e-
Government  initiatives. Uruguay hopes to be in a position to share future developments at future 
Fora.  
7. The Spanish Ministry of Justice reiterated its offer to put the technology and experience it 
has acquired in developing the Spanish e -APP system at the disposal of any interested State.3  
                                                 
2 Andorra, Belgium, Bulgaria, Colombia, Co sta Rica, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Nicaragua, Peru, Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Spain, Russian Federation, Uruguay, California, Colorado, Kansas, 
North Carolina, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and West Virginia (all Un ited States of America).  
3 For a full description of the Spanish e -APP system, see the “Report on the exportability of the Spanish e -APP 
system”, which is available in English, French, Spanish and German on the “Apostille Section” of the Hague 
Conference w ebsite (<  www.hcch.net  >). 
3 e-Apostilles  
8. Participants confirmed the C&R Nos 5  to 7 of the  Izmir Forum  concerning  e-Apost illes. 
The participants noted t he increase in the number of electronic public documents issued  around 
the globe and that e -Apostilles offer the only solution for apostilli sing electronic public 
documents . Participants recalled the fact that the majority of  States have adopted legislation 
recognising the functional equivalence of electronic signatures to handwritten signatures , and 
the principle that  e-Apostilles  continue to be  valid  even after the digital certificate of the person 
signing the e -Apostille expires , provided t hat the digital certificate  was valid wh en the e -
Apostille was issued . Participants also reiterated the good practice of applying high standards to 
the issuance and management of digital credentials . 
9. Participants noted that two different s ystems relating to the issuance of e-Apos tilles are 
currently  in use among the Contracting States to the Convention : the dynamic system and the 
static  system . Under the dynamic  system, the electronic file containing the e -Apostille and the 
electronic publi c document is transmitted electronically from the State of origin to the State of 
destination. The e -Apostille can be subsequently verified in the e -Register of the Competent 
Authority. This system is currently in use in Spain, Colombia, and New Zealand. U nder the 
static  system, the electronic file containing the e -Apostille and the electronic public document is 
stored in a repository  of the Competent Authority  (usually, its e -Register) and is not  transmitted. 
The file can be viewed  by the applicant and / or recipient by accessing the Competent 
Authority’s repository. This system has been adopted by the Republic of Moldova.  
10. Participants noted that some jurisdiction s have started to issue  only e-Apostilles for both 
electronic documents and for paper public do cuments that are subsequently scanned or 
digitalised. In these jurisdictions , paper Apostille s will no longer be issued  and only e -Apostilles 
will be issued for public documents . Participants reaffirmed the good practice of inform ing the 
Permanent Bureau o f the Hague Conference and the Depositary ( i.e. the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands) when Contracting States begin issuing e -Apostilles .  
11. Participants noted that jurisdictions are increasingly issuing e-Apostilles for paper pu blic 
documents which are subsequently scanned or digitalised. The law of the issuing State 
determines how and by whom paper public documents are to be scanned or digitalised. The 
participants noted the different practices and reaffirmed the fundamental fun ction of Competent 
Authorities to verify the authenticity of public documents and the need to adopt practices which 
allow assessing the genuine character of all documents presented  as public documents for the 
issuance of an Apostille.  
12. Participants recognis ed the benefits of using modern technologies in providing Apostille 
services (incl. reducing the turnaround  time in  the issuance of Apostilles) and noted that one 
jurisdiction  (Colombia)  has implemented an online  e-Apostille service , which is available 
24 hours  a day,  7 days a week.  In addition, the use of modern technologies facilitates the 
implementation  of a one-step process ( i.e. the public document is transmitted directly from the 
issuing authority to the Competent Authority for apostillisation without  the need for prior 
authentication within  the State of origin ). 
13. Participants noted that some e-APP jurisdictions have passed laws  or regulations  
specifically enabling their Competent Authorities to issue e-Apostilles , whereas others have not . 
It is for the  law of the issuing State to determine whether such measures are necessary .  
14. Because of its importance, p articipants reiterated and confirmed C&R No 6 of the 
6th International  Forum on the e -APP ( held in Madrid from 29 to 30 June 2010, hereinafter 
“Madrid Forum ”) and No  9 of the Izmir  Forum , which reads as follows:  
“[T]he Forum participants again emphasised the fundamental principle of the 
Convention according to which an Apostille validly issued in one State Party must 
be accepted in other States Party; t he Forum participants stressed that this principle 
also applies to e -Apostilles issued in accordance with domestic law of the issuing 
State. Not extending this basic principle to e -Apostilles would provide receiving 
States with more power in the electronic  environment than they have in the paper 
environment. Such a double standard would be very unsatisfactory as the use of e -
Apostilles offers a far higher security standard than paper Apostilles.  
4 This recognition of foreign e -Apostilles is further supported by the fact that the 
majority of States have adopted legislation to the effect that electronic signatures 
are the functional equivalent of manuscript (holographic) signatures. Finally, 
Forum participants stressed the great advantage of the parallel use of an e-Register 
if and when a Competent Authority issues e -Apostilles; the possibility to also 
verify the origin of an e -Apostille in the relevant e -Register should provide 
recipients of e -Apostilles with all the necessary assurance. ” 
15. Participants recalled t hat Apostilles, whether in paper or in electronic format, do not affect 
the acceptance, admissibility or probative value of the underlying public document. Participants 
further noted that a State of destination may not reject e -Apostilles on the sole groun d that the 
State of issuance or the State of destination do es not have legislation concerning e -Apostilles.  
16. Participants noted the “ Interpol e-extradition initiative”, which aims at developing viable 
tools for the swift and secure electronic transmission o f extradition requests between Interpol 
countries . This initiative seeks to combine the strengths of the e -APP with the ones of the  
e-extradition initiative  in cases where requests for extradition are subject to authentication (by 
means of an Apostille) .   
e-Registers  
17. The participants confirmed the C&R Nos 10 to 11 of the Izmir Forum  concerning  
e-Registers. Participants noted t he need for e-Register s to comply with the requirements set out 
in Article 7 of the  Apostille Convention  and encouraged  Competent Au thorities to implement 
Categories 2 or 3  e-Registers ; participants  noted that Category 1 e -Register s do not provide the 
assurance that the relevant Apostille is being used with the underlying public document for 
whic h it was originally issued . Participants  further recalled that the full display of the Apostille 
and/or the underlying public document  is subject to data protection laws of the jurisdiction 
operating the e -Register. In addition,  participants reiterated that e-Registers must prevent 
“fishing expe ditions” ; they also recalled the good practice s of adding a Quick Response (QR) 
code to paper Apostilles and of using Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates or similar 
technology for  the website of  e-Registers.  
Taking stock and the future direction of t he Apostille Convention and the e -APP in Latin 
America  
18. Participants recalled the 2006 declaration of the Ministers of Justice of the MERCOSUR 
States Parties and of Bolivia and Chile promoting the accession and effective implementation of 
the Apostille Con vention as a means to strengthen , intensify and streamline legal co -operation 
among States in the region , as well as the recent Declaration of the Inter -American Bar 
Association, adopted 24 June 2013, which recommends that all States in the region  join the  
Apostille Convention  as it greatly facilitates administrative proceedings for individuals and 
businesses and furthers the development of foreign investment and international transactions .   
19. Participants noted with great satisfaction that the Congresses of  Paraguay and Chile have 
already approved the ir respective accessions to the Apostille Convention and although they still 
have to complete the proce edings for accession they are both actively working on the 
implementation of the Convention and possibly imp lementing one or both of the e -APP 
components. Accession to the Convention is also being considered by the Guatemalan Congress , 
while Brazil  is actively considering acceding to the Apostille Convention .  
20. Noting that three States in Latin America (Chile, Me xico and Peru) are Member 
Economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Co -operation (APEC), participants recognised the 
significance of the October 2013 statement by the APEC Ministers that APEC -wide adoption of 
the Apostille Convention would facilitate the achi evement of “ease of doing business” targets in 
the area of trading across borders and advance institutional connectivity among APEC 
authorities. Noting that the Apostille Convention is not in force in several APEC Member 
Economies, participants also welcom ed the call by APEC Ministers for wider participation in 
the Apostille Convention.  
5 21. Participants welcomed  the efforts of some Contracting States aimed at improving  the 
operation of the Apostille Convention,  and noted in particular the steps taken by Mexico to 
harmonise the procedure for the  issuance of Apostilles among a ll its Competent Authorities.  
9th International Forum on the e -APP 
22. Participants  warmly  welcomed the announcement by the representative of the Department 
of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Ad ministrative Region of the People's Republic of China  to 
host the 9 th International Forum on the e -APP in Hong Kong in late 2014. The Forum will be 
organised in collabor ation with  the Permanent Bureau and its Asia  Pacific Regional Office . This 
will be the first e -APP Forum to be held in the Asia  Pacifi c region. Participants congratulated 
the Hong Kong Department of Justice  for its initiative and reiterated  the importance and value 
of considering geographic and legal diversity when choosing a venue  for an e -APP Forum .

17-18 октября 2013 - Монтевидео, Уругвай
ВЫВО
ДЫ И РЕКОМЕНДАЦИИ
Бо
лее 90 экспертов из 31 государства и международной организации собрались в 
Монтевидео, Уругвай, для участия в 18-м Международном форуме по программе 
электронного апостиля (e -APP).  Форум был проведен под эгидой министерства 
иностранных дел Уругвая и организован в сотрудничестве с Постоянным бюро Гаагской 
конференции по международному частномуправу и ее Латиноамериканским региональным отделением в Буэнос- Айресе (Аргентина).  
Участники выразили свою признательность министерству иностранных дел Уругвая за 
щедрое проведение этого мероприятия - первого Форума, который будет проведен в 
Латинской Америке и Южном полушарии, - и были удостоены чести присутствовать  на 
нем заместителя министра иностранны х дел Уругвая Его Превосходительства Луиса 
Порту, который открыл это мероприятие вместе с Генеральным секретарем Гаагской конференции по международному частному праву.  Г -н Кристоф Бернаскони. 
Участники признали, что Форум в Монтевидео предоставляет прекрасную возможность 
для обмена информацией о внедрении и последних разработках e- APP, позволяя 
государствам извлечь уроки из опыта растущего числаюрисдикций e- APP. Этому Форуму 
удалось объединить почти все государства Латинской Америки, все из которых являются 
либо Договаривающимися государствами  Гаагской конвенции от 5 октября 1961 года об 
отмене требования легализации иностранных официальных документов   (Конвенция об 
апостиле), либо активно расс матривают вопрос о присоединении. Кроме того, участники 
приветствовали присутствие государств из регионов, которые в настоящее время 
недопредставлены договаривающимися государствами Конвенции, таких, как Ближний Восток и южная часть Африки, что  подтвержда ет тот факт, что интерес к Конвенции об 
апостиле и электронной АПП продолжает расти во всех регионах мира.  
Участники призвали все национальные учреждения Договаривающихся государств из 
частного и государственного секторов взять на себя обязательства по усп ешному развитию 
этого процесса.  
Участники также напомнили о том, что Конвенция об апостиле, как было показано, 
помогает государствам в создании условий, более благоприятных для иностранных инвестиций и международной торговли. В частности, участники нес инт ересом 
ознакомились с Докладом Международной финансовой корпорации Группы Всемирного банка за 2010 год, озаглавленным « Инвестирование через границу», в котором 
рассматривается регулирование прямых иностранных инвестиций в 87 странах и признается положительное влияниеКонвенции Apostille на способность иностранных компаний создавать и вести бизнес.  
Участники единогласно пришли к следующим выводам и вынесли следующие рекомендации: 
1 Андорра, Аргентина, Австрия, Бразилия, Чили, Китай (САР Гонконг), Колумбия, Коста Венгрия, Гватемала, 
Доминиканская Республика, Италия, Рика, Корея (Республика), Мексика, Намибия, Никарагуа, Новая 
Зеландия, Парагвай, Перу, Португалия, Сальвадор, Эквадор, К атар Республика Молдова, Российская 
Федерация, Южная Африка, Испания, Соединенное Королевство Великобритании Великобритания и Северная Ирландия (включая Бермудские острова), Соединенные Штаты Америки, Уругвай и представитель Интерпола.

2 Программа электронного апостиля (e -APP) в целом  
1. Участник   НТС  поздравил многие компетентные органы, которые в настоящее время
насчитывают более 160 из 18 Договаривающихся государств, которые уже внедрили один
или оба компонента e -APP. 2Они особенно приветствовали юрисдикции, которые
присоединились к e -APP после 7th Международного форума по e -APP (состоявшегося в
Измире с 14 по 15 июня 2012 года, далее «Измирский форум»), а именно Ирландию,Никарагуа, Словению (11 окружных судов) и Уругвай. Кроме того, участникиприветствовали усилия ряда государств и юрисдикций  по активному осуществлению
одного или обоих компонентов электронной АПП. Участники также с интересо
м
о
тметили, что новые Договаривающиеся государства все чаще учитывают электронную
АПП в своих усилиях по присоединению к Конвенции. Участники приветствовали
объявление  Соединенного Королевства о запуске электронного реестра, запланированном
на конец октября 2013 года, объявление Республики Молдова о выдаче электронногоапостиля с 1 октября 2013 года, а также объявление Никарагуа о запуске своего
электронного реестра апостилей в мае 2013 года.
2. У
частники приветствовали публикацию Руководства по практическому действию
Конвенции об апостиле  (Apostille Handbook), опубликованного в апреле 2013 года, в том
числе главы 6, которая дополняет  е-APP.
3. У
частники далее с удовлетворением отметили поддержку совещания Специальной
комиссии по практическому действию Конвенции об апостиле  в 2012 году, которая
«признает ценность электронного АПП как инструмента дальнейшего обеспечения и
эффективного функционирования  Конвенции об апос тиле, и с удовлетворением отмечают
продолжение внедрения э -АППО и расширение использования электронных апостилей и
электронных регистров».
4. У
частники далее отметили, что общее число электронных апостилей, выдаваемых
компетентными органами во всем мире с момента начала действия e- APP, продолжает
расти.
5. У
частники призвали все Договаривающиеся государства Конвенции об апостиле
активно рассмотреть вопрос о внедрении электронной АПП. Участники также призваликомпетентные органы, заинтересованные во внедрении одно го или обоих компонентов
электронной АПП, проконсультироваться с другими компетентными органами, которыеуже внедрили соответствующий компонент(ы). Участники признали преимуществаналаживания диалога междуконкурирующими органами в отношении внедрения e -APP
,
ч
то будет способствовать развитию надлежащей практики и повышению осведомленности
государственных органов о различных системах e -APP, действующих во всем мире.
О
существление Конвенции об апостоле электронной АПП в Уругвае  
6. Участники поздравили соответств ующие уругвайские власти с первой годовщиной
присоединения Уругвая к Конвенции и выразили надежду на многообещающее будущее всвязи с разработкой и внедрением электронного регистра категории 2. Уругвай приложилогромные усилия для осуществления Конвенции о б апостиле и находится в начал
е
п
роцесса децентрализации службы своего компетентного органа в целях содействия
включению и социальной интеграции всех своих граждан. В то же время в настоящеевремя ведется работа по внедрению компонента электронного апостил я, который является
одним из ключевых элементов планов Уругвая в отношении его инициатив в областиэлектронного правительства. Уругвай надеется, что сможет поделитьсябудущимиуспехами разработчиков на будущих Форумах.
7. М
инистерство юстиции Испании подтверди ло свое предложение предоставить
технологию и опыт, приобретенные им в области разработки испанской системыэлектронных АПП, в распоряжение любого заинтересованного государства.

3 8. Участники подтвердили  C&R № № 5- 7 Измирского форума относительно
электронных апостилей. Участники отметили увеличение числа электронных публичных
документов, выдаваемых по всему миру, и то, что электронные апостили предлагаютединственное решение для апостилирования электронны х публичных документов.
Авторыстатьи напомнили о том, что большинство государств приняли законодательство,признающее функциональную эквивалентность электронных подписей собственноручнымподписям, и принцип, согласно которому электронный апостиль остается в силе даже
послеистечения срока действия цифрового удостоверения лица, подписывающегоэлектронный апостиль, при условии, что цифровой сертификат был действителен намомент выдачи электронного апостиля. Участники также подтвердили надлежащуюпрактику приме нения высоких стандартов при выпуске цифровых документов и
управлении ими.
9. У
частники отметили, что в настоящее время в Договаривающихся государствах
Конвенции используются две различные системы, связанные с выдачей электронныхапостилей: динамическая система и статическая система. В рамках динамической  системы
электронный файл,  содержащий электронный апостиль и электронный публичныйдокумент, передается в электронном виде из государства происхождения в государствоназначения. Электронный апостиль может быть  впоследствии проверен в электронном
реестре компетентного органа. Эта системашироко используется в Испании, Колумбии и
Новой Зеландии. В рамках  статической  системы электронный файл, содержащий
электронный апостиль и электронный публичный документ, храни тся в хранилище
компетентного органа (как правило, его электронного реестра) и не передается. Файл
может быть просмотрен заявителем и /или получателем, обратившись к репозиториюкомпетентного органа. Эта система была принята Республикой Молдова.
10. У
частники отметили, что некоторые юрисдикции начали выдавать только
электронные апостиликак для электронных документов, так и для бумажных публичныхдокументов, которые впоследствии сканируются или оцифровываются. В этихюрисдикциях бумажный апостиль больше не будет  выдаваться, и будут выдаваться только
электронные апостили для публичных документов. Участники подтвердилинадлежащуюпрактику информирования Постоянного бюро Гаагской конференции и депозитария (т.е.
министерства иностранных дел Королевства Нидерландов) о  том, когда
Договаривающиеся государства начинают выдавать электронные апостили.
11. У
частники отметили, что юрисдикции все чаще выдают электронные апостили для
бумажных публичных документов, которые впоследствии сканируются илиоцифровываются. Право государс тва, выдавшего документ, определяет, каким образом и
кем должны сканироваться или оцифровываться бумажные публичные документы.Участники отметили различнуюпрактику и подтвердили основополагающую функцию
компетентных органов по проверке подлинности публичны х документов и необходимость
принятия практики, позволяющей оценить подлинный характер всех документов,
представленных в качестве публичных документов, для выдачи  апостиля.
12. У
частники признали преимущества использования современных технологий в
предоставлени и услуг апостиля (в т.ч. сокращение сроков оформления апостиля) и
отметили, что в одной юрисдикции (Колумбия) внедрена онлайн -услуга электронног о
а
постиля, которая доступна 24 часа в сутки, 7 дней в неделю. Кроме того, использование
современных технологий облегчает осуществление одноэтапного процесса (т.е.
публичный документ передается непосредственно из органа, выдавшего документ,компетентному органу для апостилирования без необходимости предварительного
удостоверения подлинности в государстве происхожде ния).
13. У
частники отметили, что некоторые юрисдикции e -APP приняли законы или
правила, специально позволяющие их компетентным органам выдаватьэлектронные
апостиль, в то время как другие этого не сделали. Вопрос о необходимости таких меропределяется правом государства, выдавшего документ.
14. В
 силу своей важности участники повторили и подтвердили C&R № 66-го
APP", которая доступна на английском, французском, испанском и немецком языках в разде ле "Апостиль" веб -
сайта Гаагской конференции (< www.hcch.net  >). 
4 Международного  форума по e -APP (проходившего в Мадриде с 29 по 30 июня 2010 года, 
далее «Мадридский форум») и № 9 Измирского форума, который гласит следующее:  
"Участники Форума вновь подчеркнули основополагающий принцип 
Конвенции, согласно которому апостиль, законно выданный в одном государстве -участнике, должен быть принят в других государствах -
участниках; участники Форума подчеркнули, что этот принцип применяется также к электронным апостилям, выдаваемым в соответствии с внутренним 
законодательством государства, выдавшего его. Если не распространить 
этотпринцип basic на электронные апостили, принимающие государства получат больше полномочий в электронной среде, чем в бумажной среде. 
Такой двойной стандарт был бы очень неудовлетворительным, поскольку использование электронного апостиля предлагает гораздо более высокий стандарт безопасности, чем  бумажный апостиль.  
Это признание иностранных электронных апост илей также подтверждается 
тем фактом, что большинство государств приняли законодательство о том, что электронные подписи являются функциональным эквивалентом рукописных (голографическихс) подписей. Наконец  
Участники Форума подчеркнули большое преимущество параллельного 
использования электронного регистра, если и когда компетентный орган 
выдает электронный апостиль; возможность также проверить происхождение 
электронного апостиля в соответствующем электронном реестре должна обеспечить получателям электронных апостилей все необходимые гарантии».  
15. Участники напомнили, что апостиль, будь то в бумажном или электронном формате,
не влияет на принятие, допустимость или доказательную ценность основного публичного
документа. Participants далее отметили, что государство назначения не может отказать в
электр онном апостиле только на том основании, что государство выдачи или государство
назначения не имеют законодательства, касающегося электронного апостиля.
16. У
частники отметили "Инициатива Интерпола по электронной выдаче ", который
направлен на разработку жизнеспособных и нструментов для быстрой и безопасной
электронной передачи запросов о выдаче между странами Интерпола. Эта инициатива
направлена на объединение сильных сторон e- APP с преимуществами инициативы по
электронной выдаче в cases, где просьбы о выдаче подлежат удо стоверению подлинности
(с помощью апостиля).
Э
лектронные реестры  
17. Участники подтвердили C&R No № 10-11 Измирского форума по электронным
регистрам. Участники отметили необходимость того, чтобы электронные реестрысоответствовали требованиям, изложенным в статье 7 Конвенции об апостиле, и призвали
компетентные органы внедрить электронные реестры категорий 2 или 3; участникиотметили, что электронные реестры категории 1 не обеспечивают гарантии того, чтосоответствующий апостиль  используется с основным публичн ым документом, для
которого он был первоначально выдан. Участники далее напомнили, что полноеотображение апостиля и/или основного публичного документа регулируется законами о
защите данных юрисдикции, действующейв электронном реестре. Кроме того, участник
и
в
новь заявили, что электронные регистры должны предотвращать «рыболовные
экспедиции»; они также напомнили о передовой практике добавления кода быстрого
реагирования (QR) к бумажным апостилям и использования SSL -сертификатов
расширенной проверки (EV)или аналогичной технологии для веб -сайта электронных
регистров.
П
одведение итогов и будущее направление Конвенции об апостиле и e -APP в 
Латинской Америке  
18. Участники напомнили о заявлении министров юстиции государств- участников
МЕРКОСУР и Боливии и Чили 2006 года  о содействии присоединению к Конвенции об
апостиле и ее эффективном осуществлении в качестве средства укрепления, активизации и
5 упорядочения правового сотрудничества между государствами региона, а также о 
недавней Декларации Международного пакта.  Американская ассоциация адвокатов, 
принятая 24 июня 2013 года, которая рекомендует всем государствам региона присоединиться к Конвенции об апостиле, поскольку она значительно облегчает административное разбирательство для физических и юридических лиц и способству ет 
развитию иностранных и международных сделок.  
19. Участники с большим удовлетворением отметили, что конгрессы Парагвая и Чили
уже одобрили свое соответствующее присоединение к Конвенции об апостиле и, хотя имеще предстоит завершить процессприсоединения, они оба активно работают надосуществлением Конвенции и, возможно, осуществляют один или оба компонента e -APP.
Конгресс Гватемалы также рассматривает вопрос о присоединении к Конвенции, аБразилия активно рассматривает вопрос о присоединении к Конвенции об апостиле.
20. О
тметив, что три государства Латинской Америки (Чили, Мексика и Перу) являются
странами -участницами Азиатско -Тихоокеанского экономического сотрудничества
(АТЭС), участники признали важность принятого в октябре 2013года министрами АТЭ С
з
аявления о том, что принятие А ТЭС Конвенции об апостиле в масштабах всего АТЭС
будет способствовать достижению целей «легкости ведения бизнеса» в областитрансграничной торговли и развитию институциональной взаимосвязанности междуорганами АТЭС. Отме тив, чтоКонвенция об апостиле не действует в ряде стран -членов
АТЭС, участники также приветствовали призыв министров АТЭС к более широкомуучастию в Конвенции об апостиле.
21. У
частники приветствовали усилия некоторых Договаривающихся государств,
направленные на совершенствование действия Конвенции об апостиле, и отметили, вчастности, шаги, предпринятые Мексикой для согласования процедуры выдачи апостилявсеми ее компетентными органами.

17-18 octombrie 2013 -   Montevideo, Uruguay  
CONCLUZII ȘI RECOMANDĂRI  
Peste 90 de experți din 31 de state și o organizație internațională s -au reunit la Montevideo, 
Uruguay, pentru a participa la cel 1de-al 8- lea Forum Internațional privind Programul electronic 
de apostilă (e -APP).  Forumul s -a desfășurat sub auspiciile Ministerului Afacerilor Externe din 
Uruguay și a fost organizat în colaborare cu Biroul Permanent al Conferinței de la Haga privind 
internarea priva tăal Dreptului și cu Biroul regional latino- american din Buenos Aires (Argentina).  
Participanții și- au exprimat recunoștința față de Ministerul Afacerilor Externe al Uruguayului 
pentru găzduirea cu generozitate a evenimentului - primul Forum care va avea l oc în America 
Latină șiemisfera sud -ruri - și au fost  onorați  de prezența viceministrului afacerilor externe al 
Uruguayului, Excelența Sa Luis Porto, care a deschis evenimentul împreună cu Secretarul General al Conferinței de la Haga privind dreptul inte rnațional privat,  Dl Christophe Bernasconi.  
Participanții au recunoscut că Forumul de la Montevideo a oferit o oportunitate excelentă pentru 
schimbul de informații cu privire la punerea în aplicare și la cele mai recente evoluții ale 
aplicației electronice, permițând statelor să învețe din experienț a unui număr tot mai mare 
dejurisdicții e -APP. Acest forum a reușit să reunească aproape toate statele din America Latină, 
toate acestea fiind fie state contractante la  Convenția de la Haga din 5 octombrie 1961 de 
eliminare a cerinței legalizării documentelor publice străine   (Convenția apostilă), fie având în 
vedere în mod activ aderarea. În plus, participanții au salutat prezența statelor din regiuni care 
sunt în prezent subreprezentate între statele contractante la convenție, cum ar fi Orientul Mijlociu  
și Africa de Sud,  care reafirmă faptul că interesul pentru Convenția privind apostila și e- APP 
continuă să crească în toate regiunile lumii.  
Participanții au încurajat toate instituțiile naționale ale statelor contractante din sectorul privat și 
public s ă se angajeze să se angajeze în dezvoltarea cu succes a procesului.  
Participanții au reamintit, de asemenea, că s- a demonstrat că Convenția privind apostila ajută 
statele să stabilească condiții mai supuse investițiilor străine și comerțului internațional.  În 
special, participanții nuau abordat cu interes Raportul din 2010 al Corporației Financiare 
Internaționale a Grupului Băncii Mondiale intitulat  Investiția transfrontalieră, care analizează 
reglementarea investițiilor străine directe în 87 de economii și  care recunoaște impactul pozitiv 
alConvenției Apostille asupra capacității companiilor străine de a înființa și desfășura activități 
comerciale.  
Participanții au ajuns în unanimitate la următoarele concluzii și au făcut următoarele 
recomandări:   
 
1 Andorra, Argentina, Austria, Brazilia, Chile, China (RAS Hong Kong), Columbia, Costa Rica, Republica 
Dominicană, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Ungaria, Italia, Coreea (Republica), Mexic, Namibia, Noua Zeelandă, 
Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Portugalia, Qat ar Republica Moldova, Federația Rusă, Africa de Sud, Spania, Regatul Unit 
al Marii Marea Britanie și Irlanda de Nord (inclusiv Bermuda), Statele Unite ale Americii, Uruguay și un reprezentant 
al INTERPOL.

 Programul  electronic de apostilă (e -APP) în general  
1. Ceidoi au felicitat numeroasele autorități competente - care numără în prezent peste 160 
din 18 state contractante - care au implementat deja una sau ambele componente ale e- APP. 
Aceștia au salutat în 2special jurisdicțiile care s- au alăturat app -ului electr onic de laForumul 
internațional de 7 t h privindaplicația electronică (care a avut loc la Izmir în perioada 14 -15 iunie 
2012, denumit în continuare "Forumul Izmir"), și anume Irlanda, Nicaragua, Slovenia (11 
instanțe districtuale) și Uruguay. În plus, part icipanții au aplaudat eforturile mai multor state și 
jurisdicții de a urmări în mod activ punerea în aplicare a uneia sau a ambelor componente ale e-
APP. Participanții au remarcat, de asemenea, cu interes că noile state contractante iau din ce în ce 
mai mu lt în considerare e- APP în eforturile lor de a adera la convenție. Participanții au salutat  
anunțul Regatului Unit privind lansarea registrului său electronic planificat pentru sfârșitul lunii 
octombrie 2013, anunțul Republicii Moldova privind emiterea de  e-apostile de la 1 octombrie 
2013, precum și anunțul Nicaragua privind lansarea Registrului electronic al apostilelor în mai 
2013.  
2. Participanții au salutat publicarea Manualului privind funcționarea practică a Convenției 
apostilei   (Manualul apostilei), publicat în aprilie 2013, inclusiv capitolul 6, care adaugăses app-
ul electronic.  
3. Participanții au remarcat, de asemenea, cu satisfacție sprijinul reuniunii din 2012 a 
Comisiei speciale privind funcționarea practică a Convenției privind apostila, care "recu noaște 
cu satisfacție valoarea e- APP ca instrument de securizare și de punere în aplicare în continuare a 
Convențieiprivind apostila și constată cu satisfacție continuarea punerii în aplicare a app -ului 
electronic și extinderea utilizării e- apostilelor și a registrelor electronice".  
4. Participanții au remarcat, de asemenea, că numărul total de apostile electronice emise de 
autoritățile competente din întreaga lume de la începutul e -APP continuă să crească.  
5. Participanții au încurajat toate statele contractante la Convenția privind apostila să ia în 
considerare în mod activ punerea în aplicare a app -ului electronic. Participanții au încurajat, de 
asemenea, autoritățile competente care sunt interesate să pună în aplicare una sau ambele componente ale e- APP să se consulte cu alte autorități competente care au pus deja în aplicare 
componenta (componentele) relevantă (relevante). Participanții au recunoscut beneficiile 
instituirii unui dialog întreautoritățile competent în ceea ce privește punerea în aplicare a e- APP, 
care va facilita dezvoltarea de bune practici și va spori gradul de conștientizare în rândul 
autorităților de stat cu privire la diferitele sisteme de e -APP în funcțiune în întreaga lume  
Punerea în aplicare a Convenției de la Apostille și a e -APP în Uruguay  
6. Participanții au felicitat autoritățile uruguayene relevante cu ocazia primei aniversări a 
aderării Uruguayului la Convenție și se așteptau la un viitor promițător odată cu dezvoltarea și 
punerea în aplicare a unui registru electronic de categoria 2. U ruguayul a depus eforturi mari 
pentru a pune în aplicare Convenția de la Apostilă și se află la începutul procesului de descentralizare a serviciului autorității sale competente, în vederea favorizării incluziunii și integrării sociale a tuturor citizelor sale. În același timp, în prezent se lucrează la punerea în 
aplicare a componentei e- Apostille, care este un element -cheie al planurilor Uruguayului în ceea 
ce privește inițiativele sale de guvernare electronică. Uruguay speră să fie în măsură să împartă elopments viitor laFora viitoare.  
7. Ministerul spaniol al Justiției și- a reiterat oferta de a pune tehnologia și experiența pe care 
le-a dobândit în dezvoltarea sistemului spaniol e -APP la dispoziția oricărui stat interesat.

Apostile  
8. Participanții au confirmat C&R Nos 5 la 7 al Forumului Izmir privind e -Apostilele. 
Participanții au remarcat creșterea numărului de documente publice electronice emise în întreaga lume și că e- Apostilele oferă singura soluție pentru apostilizarea documente lor publice 
 
2 Andorra, Belgia, Bulgaria, Columbia, Costa Rica, Republica Dominicană, Georgia, Irlanda, Mexic, Noua Zeelandă, 
Nicaragua, Peru, Republica of Moldova, Slovenia, Spania, Federația Rusă, Uruguay, California, Colorado, Kansas, 
Carolina de Nord, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington și Virginia de Vest (toate State le Unite ale Americii).  
3 Pentru o descriere completă a sistemului e-APP spaniol, consultați "Raport on exportabilitatea sistemului spaniol e -
APP", care este disponibil în limbile engleză, franceză, spaniolă și germană pe "Secțiunea apostilă" de pe site-ul  
Conferinței de la Haga ( < www.hcch.net  >).

 electronice. Participants a reamintit faptul că majoritatea statelor au adoptat o legislație care 
recunoaște echivalența funcțională a semnăturilor electronice cu semnăturile olografe și 
principiul conform căruia e -Apostilele continuă să fie valabile chiar și după expirarea ce 
rtificatului digitalal persoanei caresemnează apostila electronică, cu condiția ca certificatul digital 
să fie valabil la momentul emiterii e -Apostilei. Participanții au reiterat, de asemenea, bunele 
practici de aplicare a  unor standarde ridicate în ceea ce privește emiterea și 
gestionarearedentialelor digitale.  
9. Participanții au remarcat că două sisteme diferite legate de emiterea de e- Apostile sunt 
utilizate în prezent între statele contractante la convenție: sistemul dina mic și sistemul static. În 
cadrul sistemului dinamic,   fișierul electronic care conține apostila electronică și documentul 
public electronic se transmit electronic din statul de origine în statul de destinație. Apostila 
electronică poate fi verificată ulterior în registrul electronic al autorității competente. Acest 
sistem este currently în uz în Spania, Columbia, și Noua Zeelandă. În cadrul sistemului static,   
fișierul electronic care conține apostila electronică și documentul public electronic este stocat  
într-un depozit al autorității competente (de obicei, registrul electronic al acesteia) și nu este 
transmised. Dosarul poate fi vizualizat de solicitant și/sau destinatar accesând depozitul autorității 
competente. Acest sistem a fost adoptat de Republica Moldova.  
10. Participanții au remarcat că unele jurisdicții au început să emită doar e -Apostilles for atât 
documente electronice, cât și pentru documente publice pe suport de hârtie care sunt ulterior 
scanate sau digitalizate. În aceste jurisdicții, Apostilele pe suport de hârtie nu vor mai fi emise și 
numai e -Apostile vor fi emise pentru documente publice. Participanții au reafirmatbunele practici 
de informare a Biroului Permanent al Conferinței de la Haga și a Depozitarului  (șianume,  
Ministerul Afacerilor E xterne al Regatului Țărilor de Jos) atunci când statele contractante încep 
să emită e- Apostile.  
11. Participanții au remarcat faptul că jurisdicțiile emit din ce în ce mai mult apostile 
electronice pentru documente publice pe suport de hârtie care sunt ulterior scanate sau 
digitalizate. Legislația statului emitent stabilește modul și de către cine trebuie scanate sau digitalizate documentele publice pe suport de hârtie. Participanții au luat act depracticile diferite 
și aureafirmat funcția fundamentală a autori tăților competente de a verifica autenticitatea 
documentelor publice și necesitatea de a adopta practici care să permită evaluarea caracterului 
real al tuturor documentelor prezentate ca documente publice pentrueliberarea unei apostile.  
12. Participanții au re cunoscut beneficiile utilizării tehnologiilor moderne în furnizarea de 
servicii Apostile (inclusiv reducerea timpului de răspuns în emiterea apostilelor) și au remarcat că 
o jurisdicție (Columbia) a implementat un serviciu online de apostilă electronică, c are este 
disponibil 24 de ore pe zi, 7 zile pe săptămână. În plus, utilizarea tehnologiilor moderne 
facilitează punerea în aplicare a unui proces într -o singură etapă  (șianume,  documentul public 
este transmis direct de la autoritatea emitentă cătreautori tateacompetentă pentru apostilare, fără a 
fi necesară autentificarea prealabilă în statul de origine).  
13. Participanții au remarcat că unele jurisdicții e- APP au adoptat legi sau reglementări care 
permit în mod specific autorităților lor competente săemită ap ostile electronice, în timp ce altele 
nu. Revine legislației statului emitent obligația de a stabili dacă astfel de măsuri sunt necesare.  
14. Datorită importanței sale, participanții au reiterat și confirmat C&R nr. 6 al celui de -al 6-lea 
Forum internațional p rivind aplicația electronică (care a avut loc la Madrid în perioada 29- 30 
iunie 2010, denumit în continuare "Forumul de la Madrid") și nr. 9 al Forumului de la Izmir, care 
are următorul cuprins:  
"[Participanții la forum] au subliniat din nou principiul fundamental al convenției 
conform căruia o apostilă emisă în mod valabil într -un stat parte trebuie acceptată 
în alte state părți; participanții la forum au subliniat că acest principiu se aplică și apostilelor electronice emise în conformitate cu dreptul in tern al statului emitent. 
Neadilia acestuiprincipiu basic la e- Apostilles ar oferi statelor receptoare mai multă 
putere în mediul electronic decât au în mediul hârtiei. Un astfel de dublu standard 
ar fi foarte nesatisfăcător, deoarece utilizarea e-  Apostil e oferă un standard de 
securitate mult mai ridicat decât apostilele de hârtie.  
Această recunoaștere a e- apostilelor străine este susținută și de faptul că 
majoritatea statelor au adoptat o legislație care să ateste că semnăturile electronice 
4 
 sunt echivalentul funcțional alsemnăturilor manuscriselor (olografice c). În cele din 
urmă,  
Participanții la forum au subliniat marele avantaj al utilizării paralele a unui 
registru electronic dacă și atunci când o autoritate competentă emite apostile 
electronice; posib ilitatea de a verifica, de asemenea, originea unei apostile 
electronice în registrul electronic relevant ar trebui să ofere destinatarilor e -
apostilelor toate asigurările necesare."  
15. Participanții au reamintit că Apostilele, fie pe suport de hârtie, fie în format electronic, nu 
afectează acceptarea, admisibilitatea sau valoarea probantă a documentului public subiacent. 
Participants au remarcat, de asemenea, că un stat de destinație nu poate respinge e -Apostilele 
pentru simplul motiv că statul emitent sau statul de destinație nu dispune de o legislație privind e -
Apostilele.  
16. Participanții au luat act de "inițialitatea interpol privind extrădareaelectronică", care vizează 
dezvoltarea unor instrumente viabile pentru transmiterea electronică rapidă și sigură a cererilor de 
extrădare între țările Interpol. Această inițiativă urmărește să combine punctele forte ale app -ului 
electronic cu cele ale inițiativei de extrădare electronică în cases în  cazul în care cererile de 
extrădare sunt supuse autentificării (prin intermediul unei apostile).  
Registre electronice  
17. Participanții au confirmat numărul 10 -11 al Forumului de la Izmir privind registrele 
electronice. Participanții au luat act de necesitatea ca registrele electronice să respecte cerințele prevăzute în art. 7 din Convenția privind apostila și au încurajat autoritățile competente să pună în aplicare registrele electronice din categoriile 2 sau 3; participanții au observat că registrele 
electro nice de categoria 1 nu oferă asigurarea că apostila relevantă este utilizată împreună cu 
documentul public subiacent pentru care a fost emisă inițial. Participanții au reamintit, de asemenea, că afișarea integrală a apostilei și/sau a documentului public subiacent face obiectul 
legislației privind protecția datelor din jurisdicția care reiesedin registrul electronic. În plus, 
participanții au reiterat faptul că registrele electronice trebuie să prevină "expedițiile de pescuit"; 
ei au reamintit, de asemenea,  bunele practici de a adăuga un cod de răspuns rapid (QR) la 
apostilele de hârtie și de a utiliza certificate ssl de validare extinsă (EV)sau tehnologii similare pentru site -ul web al registrelor electronice.  
Bilanțul și direcția viitoare a Convenției priv ind apostila și a e -APP în America Latină  
18. Participanții au reamintit declarația din 2006 a miniștrilor justiției din statele participante la 
MERCOSUR și din Bolivia și Chile, care promovează aderarea și punerea în aplicare efectivă a Convenției apostile ca  mijloc de consolidare, intensificare și eficientizare a cooperării juridice 
între statele din regiune, precum și recenta Declarație a Int  er -American Bar Association, 
adoptată la 24 iunie 2013, care recomandă ca toate statele din regiune să adere la Conv enția 
privind apostila, deoarece facilitează în mare măsură procedurile administrative pentru persoane 
fizice și întreprinderi și continuă dezvoltarea de inve -uri străineși tranzacții internaționale.  
19. Participanții au remarcat cu mare satisfacție că congres ele din Paraguay și Chile au aprobat 
deja aderările lor respective la Convenția privind apostila și, deși încă mai trebuie să finalizeze 
veniturile pentru aderare, ambele lucrează activ la punerea în aplicare a Convenției și, eventual, la 
punerea în aplicar e a uneia sau a ambelor componente ale app -ului electronic. Aderarea la 
Convenție este, de asemenea, luată în considerare de Congresul Guatemalei, în timp ce Brazilia ia 
în considerare în mod activ aderarea la Convenția privind apostila.  
20. Luând act de faptul că trei state din America Latină (Chile, Mexic și Peru) sunt economii 
membre ale cooperării economice Asia- Pacific (APEC), participanții au recunoscut importanța 
afirmării din octombrie 2013de către miniștrii APEC că adoptarea la nivel apec a Convenției 
apostilei ar facilita atingerea obiectivelor de "ușurință în a face afaceri" în domeniul comerțului 
transfrontalier și ar promova conectivitatea instituțională între autoritățile APEC. Observând 
căConvenția privind apostila nu este în vigoare în mai multe economii membre APEC, 
participanții au salutat, de asemenea, apelul miniștrilor APEC de a participa mai mult la 
Convenția privind apostila.  
21. Participanții au salutat eforturile depuse de unele state contractante în vederea îmbunătățirii 
funcționării Convenției de la Apostilă și au remarcat, în special, măsurile luate de Mexic pentru a 
5 
 armoniza procedura de emitere a apostilelor între toate autoritățile sale competente. 
Al 9-lea Forum Internațional privind e -APP 
22. Participanții au recomandat cu căldurăanunțul reprezentantului Departamentului de Justiție 
al Regiunii Administrative Speciale Hong Kong din Republica Populară Chineză de a găzdui cel 
de-al 9-lea Forum Internațional privind e -APP la Hong Kong la sfârșitul anului 2014. Forumul va 
fiorganiat în colaborare cu Biroul Permanent și Biroul Regional Asia Pacific. Acesta va fi primul Forum e -APP care va avea loc în regiunea Asia- Pacific. Participanții au felicitat Departamentul 
de Justiție din Hong Kong pentru inițiativa sa și a u reiterat  importanța și valoarea de a lua în 
considerare diversitatea geografică și juridică atunci când aleg un loc de desfășurare pentru un forum e -APP.

некоторые изменения и дополнения 8 гд нет. Приказ Министра юстиции No 163 от 15.02.2007 г . 
об оптимизации структуры Министерства юстиции и утверждении Положения о применении 
апостиля. Таким образом, согласно новым поправкам, начиная с 1  октября 2013 года, 
выдается только апостиль с цифровой подписью (e-apostille), который состоит из alonge 
(расширения документа), который будет содержать апостиль с электронной подписью и копию 
официального акта, подлежащего апостилю - оба документа находятся в файле формата pdf.
В то же время мы упоминаем, что, начиная с 01.10.2013 года, Министерство юстиции 
Республики Молдова -  как компетентный орган по применению апостиля -  больше не выдает 
апостиль, подписанный от руки, согласно старому образцу, что не влияет на действительность 
апостиля, выданного до этой даты. Подлинность апостилей, подписанных в электронном виде, 
начиная с 01.10.2013, а также подписанных от руки до этой даты, можно проверить через 
портал www.apostila.gov.md.
Для информации сообщается, что электронный апостиль реализуется 8 соответствии с 
рекомендациями Справочника по апостилю (www.hcch.net/upload/apostille_hbe.pdf), а также 
выводами (www.hcch.net/upload/e-app8uy_concl_en.pdf) Международного форума е-АРР 17-18 
октября 2013 года, состоявшегося в Монтевидео (Уругвай), где представители государств- 
членов приняли участие в Гаагской конвенции от 5 октября 1961 года.
В настоящее время система электронного апостиля используется в Королевстве Испания, 
Колумбии, Новой Зеландии, а Республика Молдова является 4-м государством, внедрившим 
рассматриваемую процедуру. В содержании электронного апостиля предлагаются 2 кода (код 
апостиля и код безопасности), которые после того, как они введены на сайте 
www.apostila.gov.md,  дают возможность проверить подлинность документа апостиля.
Более того, если будут введены оба кода (код апостиля и код безопасности), помимо 
подтверждения подлинности примененного апостиля, портал www.apostila.gov.md предложит 
возможность скачать (скачать) рассматриваемый документ в его полной версии в формате pdf 
(электронный апостиль с электронной цифровой подписью и сканированной копией 
документов, подлежащих апостилю).

Prin prezenta, cu referire la petiţia nr. 185 din 28.01.2021, privind explicarea 
procedurii de aplicare a apostilei pe anumite acte eliberate de CSJ, Direcţia apostilă 
şi legalizare din cadrul Agenţiei Resurse Informaţionale Juridice vă comunică că:
Conform art. 3 al Convenţiei cu privire la suprimarea cerinţei supralegalizării 
actelor oficiale străine, încheiata la 5 octombrie 1961, singura formalitate care ar 
putea fi cerută pentru a atesta veracitatea semnăturii, calitatea în care a acţionat 
semnatarul actului sau, după caz, identitatea sigiliului sau a ştampilei de pe acest act, 
este aplicarea apostilei.
In acelaşi context, conform pct. 4 din Regulamentul privind aplicarea 
apostilei, aprobat prin Hotărîrea Guvernului Nr.163 din 15.02.2007 prevede că 
aplicarea apostilei  - unica formalitate care poate fi solicitată pentru a atesta 
veridicitatea semnăturii, calitatea în care a acţionat semnatarul actului sau, după caz, 
autenticitatea sigiliului şi a ştampilei de pe acest act. Ţinînd cont de prevederile date, 
pentru aplicarea apostilei, actul prezentat trebuie să conţină obligatoriu, semnătura 
persoanei responsabile de eliberarea actului şi ştampila oficială a instituţiei de la care 
emană actul.
Potrivit pct. 8 al Regulamentului pentru aplicarea apostilei se prezintă doar 
actele oficiale întocmite pe teritoriul Republicii Moldova. Astfel, pct. 4 din 
Regulament, prevede că, act oficial  -  actul original, întocm it în forma stabilită de 
lege, emis de către o autoritate publică sau de către persoana autorizată de stat să 
presteze servicii publice în numele acestuia.
Totodată menţionăm că, conform pct. 9 lit. j din Regulament, Agenţia Resurse 
Informaţionale Juridice este responsabilă pentru aplicarea apostile pe copiile şi 
traducerile legalizate notarial ale actelor apostilate, ceea ce presupune că mai întîi se 
aplică apostila pe originalul actului.
Mai mult ca atât, menţionăm că, pct. 27, lit. f  din Regulament prevede că 
aplicarea apostilei poate fi refuzată dacă autoritatea responsabilă nu deţine 
specimenele semnăturilor persoanelor împuternicite şi amprenta sigiliilor sau 
ştampilelor instituţiilor corespunzătoare.
Cît priveşte traducerea încheierii prezentate, comunicăm că potrivit pct. 14 
din Regulament, dacă în statul destinatar va fi necesară prezentarea traducerii

efectuate în statul emitent, actele, după apostilare, se traduc în limba ţării de 
destinaţie de către un traducător, inclusiv apostila, după care semnătura 
traducătorului se legalizează de către un notar, iar în final pe traducerea legalizată se 
aplică apostila.
Prin unnare menţionăm că, actele anexate la prezenta petiţie, conform 
prevederilor legale, nu întrunesc cerinţele unui act oficial şi ca efect nu pot fi supuse 
procedurii de apostilare.

Дулче В. Г. будучи назначенным и ангажирован сотрудником полиции на должность 
инспектора судебной полиции КП с. Чентру, мун. Кишинэу, 17 июля 1997 г. находившейся

без какой-либо причины превысив свои полномочия, установленные Законом Республики 
Молдова "О полиции", ст. 14, 15, 16, который регулирует условия применения силы, 
специальных средств и огнестрельного оружия, ударил Алексеева М. автоматом в спину, 
затем подошел к Чемыртану С., и нанес несколько ударов прикладом автомата по разным

В результате этих действий Алексеев М. получил легкие телесные повреждения в виде

груди, спине, верхних и нижних конечностях, которые квалифицируются как легкие 
телесные повреждения с краткосрочными нарушениями здоровья.
Он же, Дулче В., 18 августа 1997 г., будучи сотрудником полиции в должности 
инспектора судебной полиции Комиссариата Полиции с. Чентру, мун. Кишинэу, в кабинете 
509 офиса Чентру, находившейся по ул. Булгарэ 40, необоснованно подозревав гр. Мачерет

средств и огнестрельного оружия, нанес Мачерету А. множества ударов резиновой палкой

подвергся пыткам и ему были причинены боли, ушибы и синяки на его плечах, спине, 
лодыжках и ногах, которые классифицируются как легкие телесные повреждения.
На судебном заседании подсудимый частично признал вину и пояснил, что 17 июля 
1997 года он дежурил в оперативной группе Комиссариата Полиции офис Чентру, КишинэуИон Бусуйок 
Мороз О.

и вместе с инспектором Симон Т. получили информацию, что на улице Исмаила группа 
молодых людей дерутся.
Вместе с Симоном Т. вышли на место происшествия и на улице Исмаил, угол с ул. М. 
Варлаам, возле бара, была группа молодых парней, двое из которых, по его мнению, 
дрались.
Он, Дольче В., вышел из машины с автоматом и задержал одного из парней по 
фамилии Чемыртан, во время задержания Чемыртан схватил автомат и тянул к себе, и в это 
время он мог ударить Чемыртана автоматом в подбородок, при этом инспектор Симон 
задержал второго парня- Алексеева М., которые были доставлены в полицию и в отношении 
парней был составлен протокол по ст. 174s КАП.
Не признает, что избивал Чемыртана или Алексеева во время задержания.
Признает вину только по эпизоду от 18 августа 1997 г. в отношении Мачерета и 
пояснил, что 18 августа 1997 г. у них была информация о том, что Мачерет А. совершил 
кражу сварочного аппарата.
Пришел по адресу Мачерета А., задержал его и доставил в комиссариат полиции по 
ул. Булгарэ 40, признает, что несколько раз ударил Мачерета резиновой битой, и 
раскаивается в содеянном.
Подсудимый не признает вину по эпизоду от 17 июля 1997 г. в отношении 
пострадавших Алексеева и Чемыртана, но его вина доказана показаниями потерпевших.
Потерпевший Чемыртан С. пояснил, что 17 июля 1997 г., вместе с Алексеевым и 
другими парнями праздновали день рождения.
Позже вечером они шли домой, по улице Исмаила угол с М. Варлаам, и когда он 
обнимался с Алексеевым, заметил, что остановилась машина и вышли двое полицейских, у 
одного из них был автомат.
Тот с автоматом подошел к ним и ударил Алексеева автоматом в спину, и тот упал, 
затем полицейский с автоматом подошел к нему и начал бить его автоматом в подбородок, 
по плечам и рукам, тогда ему пришлось защищаться, и он схватил автомат полицейского 
Дулче В.
Затем его насильно посадили в машину и доставили в отделение милиции, на него и  
на Алексеева составили протоколы по ст. 1745  КАП, но они не были виновны и на 
следующий день, в суде были оправданы.
Потерпевший Алексеев М. объяснил, что 17 июля 1997 г., вместе с Чемыртаном и 
другими ребятами шли со дня рождения где они праздновали, и шли по улице Исмаил. 
Дойдя до улицы М. Варлаам, остановилась машина «Волга», из которой вышли двое 
полицейских, один из которых Дулче В. был с автоматом.
Дулче В. подошел к ним и без всякой причины ударил Алексеева автоматом в спину 
и тот упал.
Затем он подошел к Чемыргану и начал бить его автоматом, а Чемыртан защищался.
Второй полицейский, Симон не бил их, но только помог посадить Чемыртана в 
машину, потом он, Алексеев М., сел в машину после Чемыртана, и они поехали в полицию, 
где в отношении их составили протокол по ст. 1745  КАГ1, но на следующий день они были 
оправданы в суде.
Свидетель Симон Т. пояснил, что 17 июля 1997 г., вместе с Дулче В. находились на 
работе в Комиссариате Полиции офис Чентру и вечером получили информацию о том, что 
по улице Исмаил группа парней делают шум.
Он вместе с Дулче на автомобили модели Волга прибыли по ул. Исмаил угол с ул. М. 
Варлаам, где заметили группу парней, которые, казалось бы, схватились руками.
Дулче В. вышел первый из машины с автоматом и задержал Чемыртана, Чемыртан 
схватил автомат и начал тягаться с ним, а он задержал Алексеева, они посадили Чемыртана

в машину, а затем и Алексеев сел в машину и привезли их в участок полиции, где составили 
протоколы.
Свидетель Симон сообщил, что не заметил, когда Дулче В. ударил Алексеева или 
Чемыртана автоматом.
Свидетель Крыжуновский И. пояснил, что 17 июля 1997 г. он находился в дежурной 
группе Комиссариата Полиции офис Чентру и около 02 часов ночи Дулче В. и Симон Т. 
доставили Алексеева и Чемыртана в полицию, которые были немного пьяны, в их 
отношении были составленные соответствующий протоколы и переданы в суд, не заметил, 
что бы Долче ударил кого-то из парней.
Свидетель Постеука Р. пояснил, что 17 июля 1997 г. он работал в баре "Марат" по ул. 
Исмаил и поздно вечером заметил на улице группу немного выпивших молодых людей.
В какой-то момент остановилась машина, из которой вышли два человека, у одного 
из них был автомат, а у другого резиновая бита.
Дулче с автоматом ударил Алексеева в спину и тот упал, потом Дулче начал бить 
Чемыртана автоматом по рукам и в подбородок, а Чемыртан ударился головой о стекло 
стойки бара, которое разбилось.
Затем посадили Чемыртана в машину, а Алексеев сам сел в машину после Чемыртана 
и уехали.
Свидетель объясняет, что Алексеев с Чемыртаном обнимались, а никак не дрались.
Именно такое объяснение дал свидетель Исаков И., который находился вместе с 
Алексеевым и Чемыртаном на месте происшествия по улице Исмаил, и свидетель 
Стребицкий Руслан, который также присутствовал.
Потерпевший Мачерет не явился на судебное заседание, но он подал заявление с 
просьбой рассмотреть дело в его отсутствие, поэтому суд зачитал показания потерпевшего, 
данные на предварительном следствии (л.д. 68-70), из которых исходит, что 18 августа 1997 
г., дома, на месте его проживания он был задержан капитаном Долче, который сказал, что 
был украден сварочный аппарат, и как будто этот аппарат был украден Мачеретом.
Дулче В. доставил его в полицейский участок по улице Булгарэ 40, где в кабинете 
связал ему руки и ноги за спиной, а затем несколько раз ударил его резиновой битой по 
ногам и спине, сказав ему заявить, что он украл это устройство, и что он Мачерет вынужден 
был написать такие показания.
Также были зачитаны показания свидетеля Маркова, который, мотивируя что, не смог 
явиться на судебное заседание (л.д. 108-112), из которых исходит, что 18 августа 1997 г., 
его племянник Мачерет был задержан капитаном Долче В. и доставлен в отделение 
полиции, где Долче В. нанес Мачерету удары с резиновой битой, так, что на его теле 
остались следы.
Также вина Дулче В. доказана актами судебно-медицинской экспертизы (л.д. 81, 82- 
83, 87), из которых очевидно, что потерпевшие получили телесные повреждения в 
результате действий Долче.
Таким образом, выслушав объяснения подсудимого, показания потерпевших и 
свидетелей, изучив материалы уголовного дела, суд считает, что вина подсудимого 
полностью установлена и квалифицирует его действия по ст. 185 часть (3) УК РМ, как 
превышение служебных полномочий, сопровождавшееся актами насилия, актами пыток, 
оскорбляющими личное достоинство потерпевшего, совершенными неоднократно.
При назначении метода и формы наказания для подсудимого, суд принимает во 
внимание смягчающие обстоятельства, такие как, что Долче В. раньше не был судим, 
искренне раскаивается в содеянном.
Отягчающим обстоятельством является совершение преступления путем 
издевательства над потерпевшим.

Суд также учитывает тот факт, что его действия не имеют серьезных последствий, 
поэтому суд приходит к выводу, что за преступление, совершенное подсудимым, возможно, 
и необходимо назначить условное наказание к лишению свободы с лишением права 
занимать должность в органах Министерство Внутренних Дел.
В соответствии с выше указанным и согласно со ст. 267-272 УПК РМ, суд
РЕШИЛ:
Признать Дулче Виктор Григоре виновным в совершении преступления, 
предусмотренного ст. 185 часть (3) УК РМ, и назначить ему наказание на основании этого 
закона 5 (пять) лет лишения свободы с лишением права работать или занимать должность 
в органах Министерство Внутренних Дел сроком на 5 лет.
В соответствии со ст. 43 УК РМ наказание в виде лишения свободы, назначенное 
приговором Дулче Виктор Григоре, считать условным сроком на один год.
Мера пресечения в отношении Дулче Виктора -  оставить обязанность в письменной 
форме не покидать место жительства.
Приговор с правом обжалования в Трибунал Кишинэу в течение 10 дней.

CPS Центру мун. Кишинэу, 17 июля 1997г., находясь в составе оперативной 
группы, 02:00 на перекрестке ул. Исмаил и М. Варлам Кишинэу подошел к 
Мачерет Алексею, который стоял с Чемыртан С. и без каких-либо оснований, 
•ревышая свои служебные полномочия, установленные Законом Республики 
Молдова о деятельности полиции ст. 14, 15, 16, регламентирую щ ие условия и 
пределы применения силы, специальных средств и огнестрельного оружия, 
ударил М ачерет А. автоматом в спину, затем подошел к Чемыртан С. и нанес 
ему нескольких ударов прикладом автомата по разным частям тела.
В результате данных действий М ачерет А. получил легкие телесные 
повреждения в виде синяков на спине, отека носа и ссадин в левом колене, 
которые классифицируются как легкие телесные повреждения с 
кратковременным нарушением здоровья, Чемыртан С. получил сотрясение 
мозга, ранение, тупая травма подбородка, ссадины и синяки на лице, теле, шее, 
груди, спине, верхних и нижних конечностях, которые квалифицируются как 
легкие телесные повреждения с краткосрочным повреждением здоровья.
Он же, 18 августа 1997 года будучи офицером полиции в должности 
инспектора судебной полиции CPS Центру мун. Кишинэу, в офисе 509 по ул. 
Булгарэ 40, необоснованно подозревая М ачерет А. в совершении 
преступления, превышая свои служебные полномочия, установленные 
Законом Республики М олдова о деятельности полиции ст. 14, 15, 16, 
регламентирующ ие условия и пределы применения силы, специальных 
средств и огнестрельного оружия, нанес М ачерет А. многочисленные удары 
дубинкой по разным частям тела, при этом М ачерет А. был привязан по рукам 
и ногам к спине, длительное время лежал на животе на полу.
В результате действий, подсудимый М ачерет А. подвергся пыткам и 
получил болезненные раны и синяки на плечах, спине, предплечьях и ногах, 
которые квалифицирую тся как легкие телесные повреждения.
3. 15 февраля 2021г., потерпевший М ачерет Алексей подал апелляционную 
жалобу, в котором выразил несогласие с решением суда первой инстанции.
Апеллянт, согласно ст.401-405 Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, 
потребовал возобновление судебного разбирательства 2003 года, когда жертва 
пыток была незаконно привлечена к уголовной ответственности с участием 
фигурантов и органа уголовного преследования, которые разрешили и 
скрывали это, нарушая закон № 59 о оперативной деятельности по 
привлечению к уголовной ответственности жертв пыток.

4. Определением Коллегии по уголовным делам Апелляционной Палаты 
Кишинэу от 24 июня 2021 г., провозглашенного 08 июля 2021г., апелляционная 
^ .о о а была отклонена как поданное с пропуском срока.
Апелляционная инстанция установила, что согласно ст. 402 Уголовно- 
нгоцессуального кодекса, апелляционная жалоба может быть подана в течение 
15 дней со дня провозглашения приговора в целом, если законом не 
птедусмотрено иное. Согласно ст. 403 У головно-процессуального кодекса, 
апелляционная жалоба, поданная с пропуском предусмотренного законом 
срока, считается поданной в срок, если апелляционная инстанция установила, 
что пропуск вызван обоснованными причинами, а апелляционная жалоба была 
подана не позднее чем в 15-дневный срок после начала исполнения наказания 
или взыскания материального ущерба. Согласно ст. 404 ч.(1) Уголовно- 
процессуального кодекса, участник процесса, который отсутствовал как при 
разбирательстве дела, так и при провозглаш ении приговора и не был извещен 
вынесении приговора, вправе подать апелляционную жалобу и с пропуском 
:рока, но не позднее чем в 15-дневный срок после начала исполнения 
показания или взыскания материального ущерба.
Таким образом, приговор в целом был провозглаш ен 13 октября 1998 г., 
а потерпевший М ачерет А., обжаловал в апелляционном порядке 15 февраля 
2021 г. Срок обжалования - процессуальный срок, который устанавливается 
законом. Он является абсолютным и носит императивный характер, то есть его 
пропуск влечет за собой потерю права на обжалование, но, если 
апелляционная жалоба была подана после истечения срока, она должна быть 
отклонена как поданная с пропуском срока, за исклю чением случаев, когда 
опоздание вызвано обоснованными причинами.
Согласно ст. 230 ч.(2) Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, в случае, 
когда для осущ ествления процессуального права предусмотрен определенный 
срок, несоблю дение этого срока влечет за собой потерю процессуального 
права и аннулирование действия, осуществленного по истечении срока.
Исходя из положений ст. 402 У головно-процессуального кодекса, срок 
подачи апелляционной жалобы должен исчисляться с 13 октября 1998 г. и 
истек 26 октября 1998 г. (в соответствии со сроком обжалования решения на 
тот момент), являясь и последним днем для подачи апелляционной жалобы, 
однако, апелляционная жалоба, сформулированная М ачерет А., была подана 
после последней даты подачи апелляционной жалобы, а именно 15 февраля 
2021 г., то есть более 22 лет. Фактически приговор, вынесенный 13.10.1998 г., 
был исполнен и приведен в исполнение.
з

Апеллянт не привел каких-либо обоснованных причин для пропуска 
срока подачи апелляционной жалобы, соответственно, нет оснований для 
восстановления апеллянта в срок подачи апелляционной жалобы.
В то же время, когда апелляционная инстанция отклоняет 
апелляционную жалобу как поданную с пропуском срока, не высказывается 
по правовым обстоятельствам дела и законности вынесенного решения, с этой 
точки зрения основания высказаться по законности и обоснованности 
приговора суда первой инстанции в соответствии с критикой приведенной в 
апелляционной жалобе поданной потерпевшим М ачерет А., на приговор Суда 
Чентру, мун. Киш инэу от 13.10.1998 г. не существуют.
5. Потерпевший М ачерет Алексей обжаловал кассационными жалобами 20 
июля 2021, 02 августа 2021, 09 августа 2021, 17 августа 2921, 23 августа 2021 
и 30 сентября 2021 г., выражая свое несогласие с реш ениями суда первой 
инстанции и апелляционной инстанции.
Кассатор указал, что выводы суда не соответствуют фактическим 
обстоятельствам дела и что были нарушены нормы материального и 
процессуального права.
6. Рассматривая допустимость в принципе поданных кассационных жалоб, на 
основании материалов дела и приведенным мотивам, Коллегия по уголовным 
делам приходит к выводу признать недопустимость кассационных жалоб по 
следующим соображениям.
Во-первых,  согласно ст. 427 ч.(1) Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, 
решения апелляционной инстанции могут быть обжалованы в кассационном 
порядке с целью исправления правовых ошибок, допущ енных судебными 
инстанциями, рассматривавш ими дело по существу, и апелляционными 
инстанциями, но только в соответствии с законом. Согласно ст. 424 ч.(2) 
Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, кассационная инстанция рассматривает 
дело только в пределах оснований, приведенных в кассационной жалобе. 
Согласно ст. 429 ч.(1) Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, кассационная 
жалоба должна быть мотивированной. В соответствии со ст. 430 ч.(5) 
Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, в кассационной жалобе должны 
содержаться содержание и мотивы кассационной жалобы с обоснованием 
незаконности обжалуемого решения и просьбы кассатора с указанием 
оснований, предусмотренных статьей 427, на которые он ссылается в 
кассационной жалобе, и в чем состоит правовой вопрос общего значения, 
поставленный по данному делу.
4

В кассационных жалобах, поданных 20 июля 2021, 02 августа 2021, 09 
августа 2021, несмотря на вышеуказанные требования, не приведено ни одно 
из оснований, предусмотренных ст. 427 ч.(1) Уголовно-ЦроцЭхуального 
кодекса, в которых полностью отсутствует конкретизация некоторых 
конкретных правовых ошибок, и аргументация незаконности обжалованных 
решений (п. 5 определения).
Указанные обстоятельства указывают, на то, что поданные 
кассационные жалобы, не соответствуют требованиям по содержанию, а 
кассационная инстанция по своей инициативе не вправе дополнить 
фактическими и правовыми обстоятельствами кассационную жалобу 
потерпевшего, которые могли бы ее оправдать, а затем вынести решение по 
юридически необоснованному основания кассатора.
Согласно ст. 24 ч.(2) Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, суд не 
является органом уголовного преследования, не выступает на стороне 
обвинения или защ иты и не выражает каких бы то ни было интересов, кроме 
интересов закона.
Согласно ст. 432 ч.(2) п.1) У головно-процессуального кодекса, 
кассационная инстанция выносит мотивированное определение о 
недопустимости поданной кассационной жалобы в случае установления, что 
кассационная жалоба не соответствует по форме и содержанию 
предусмотренным требованиям.
I
Следовательно, если кассационные жалобы, поданные 20 июля 2021, 02 
августа 2021, 09 августа 2021, не соответствует по форме и содержанию 
предусмотренным требованиям, их следует отклонить как недопустимыми.
Во-вторых,  согласно ст. 427 ч.(1) У головно-процессуального кодекса, 
решения апелляционной инстанции могут быть обжалованы в кассационном 
порядке с целью исправления правовых ошибок, допущ енных судебными 
инстанциями, рассматривавш ими дело по существу, и апелляционными 
инстанциями.
Согласно ст. 422 Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, срок подачи 
кассационной жалобы составляет 30 дней со дня провозглаш ения решения.
Согласно ст. 231 ч.(3), (5) Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, при 
исчислении срока часами или сутками в него не включается час или день 
начала исчисления срока, а также час и день, когда оканчивается срок. Если 
последний день срока приходится на нерабочий день, срок истекает в конце 
первого последую щ его рабочего дня. В соответствии со ст. 418 ч.(1), 338 ч.(2)
5

-(4), 340 ч.(1) У головно-процессуального кодекса, резолютивная часть 
решения или реш ение полностью провозглаш аются в открытом судебном 
заседании, о чем делается отметка в протоколе заседания. М отивированное 
решение провозглаш ается в течении 30 дней. Копия мотивированного 
решения вручается участникам, присутствующим на судебном заседании.
Согласно судебной практике ЕСПЧ, требование обнародовать решения 
не обязательно должно принимать форму устного оглаш ения решения, если 
решение публикуется, передается или отправляется сторонам. С момента 
оглашения реш ения начинается исчисление срока обжалования. Тот же факт 
предусмотрен внутренним законодательством {решение по делу Суттер против  
Швейцарии).
В связи с этим, установлено, что согласно протоколу судебного 
заседания, апелляционная инстанция провозгласила резолютивную часть 
определения 24 июня 2021 г., в присутствии потерпевш его М ачерет Алексея и 
его адвоката М ихаила Бордей (л.д.221-222, том  /).
Таким образом, мотивированное определение в соответствии с 
требованиями закона было оглашено 08.07.2021 г., а срок подачи
апелляционной жалобы истек в конце 09 августа 2021 г.
Кассационные жалобы были поданы и зарегистрированы в Высшую 
судебную палату 17 августа 2021 г., 23 августа 2021 и 3- сентября 2021 г., то 
есть с пропуском предусмотренного законном сроком {л.д.61-62, 70-75, 129-130,  
том II, п. 5 определения).
Другой информации о дате подачи соответствующ их кассационных 
жалоб в кассационной инстанции нет, ни в материалах, ни в поданных 
кассационных жалобах.
Следует отметить, что ст. 422 У головно-процессуального кодекса, не 
предусматривает восстановление пропущ енного срока подачи кассационной 
жалобы, никакой другой законной процедуры для исчисления срока 
обжалования, чем со дня вынесения мотивированного решения, а ст. 230 ч.(2) 
У головно-процессуального кодекса, предусматривает, что в случае, когда для 
осуществления процессуального права предусмотрен определенный срок, 
несоблюдение этого срока влечет за собой потерю процессуального права и 
аннулирование действия, осуществленного по истечении срока.
Следовательно, продолжительность срока обжалования устанавливается 
законом. Этот срок не может быть продлен или сокращен судом. Он
6

абсолютный, имеет императивный и фатальный характер в том смысле, что 
его пропуск влечет за собой потерю права на обжалование.
Согласно ст. 432 ч.(2) п.2) У головно-процессуального кодекса, 
кассационная инстанция выносит мотивированное определение о 
недопустимости поданной кассационной жалобы в случае установления, что 
кассационная жалоба подана с пропуском срока.
Таким образом, кассационные жалобы, поданные 17 августа 2021 г., 23 
августа 2021 и 3- сентября 2021 г., поданы с пропуском срока и следует 
признать недопустимыми.
7. В соответствии со ст. 431 ч.(1), 432 ч.(1), (2) п.1), 2), ч.(3) Уголовно­
процессуального кодекса, Коллегия по уголовным делам,
ОПРЕДЕЛИЛА:
Признать недопустимость кассационных жалоб, от 20 июля 2021, 02 
августа 2021 и 09 августа 2021 г., поданных потерпевш им М ачерет Алексеем 
на приговор Суда Чентру мун. Киш инэу от 13 октября 1998 года и на 
определение Коллегии по уголовным делам Апелляционной Палаты Кишинэу 
от 24 июня 2021 года, в отнош ении подсудимого Дулче Виктора Григорьевича, 
о мотиву, что не соответствует по форме и содержанию предусмотренным 
требованиям.

     În motivarea poziției  sale s-a referit  la faptul că a fost judecat ilegal în baza art. 
217(2) CP și 219(1) CP(1961), în situația  în care tot în aceiași  perioadă  a fost sancționat  
contravențional  pentru aceleași  fapte în cauzele contravenționale  4b-824/2006 și 
4b-1409/2006 din 07.11.2006.

поданное ***** в 2006-2008 гг., дело было передано 08.11.2019.
Находит
***** 25.04.2019 подано заявление в суд о пересмотре уголовных дел на период 
2006-2 018 годов.
Мотивируя свою позицию, он сослался на то, что его судили незаконно по ст. 217 (2) 
УК РМ и 219 (1) УК РМ (1961), в ситуации, когда в тот же период он был наказан за 
мелкие правонарушения за те же деяния по делам о правонарушениях 4b-824/2006 и 
4b-1409/2006 от 07.11.2006.
В судебном заседании рецензент ***** подтвердил свою позицию и уточнил, что 
желает пересмотреть обвинительный приговор суда Рышкановка муниципального 
округа Кишинэу от 08.11.2006, которым Мачерет признан виновным в совершении 
преступления, предусмотренного ст. 217/2. 219 (1) УК РМ (1961), окончательно 5 лет 
лишения свободы с отсрочкой исполнения сроком на один год.
Кроме того, он указал, что он не желает рассматривать случаи  нарушения 
4b-8 24/2006 и 4b-1 409/2006 от 07.11.2 006 .
Заслушав сторону, изучив документы в досье, суд считает необходимым передать  
жалобу в компетентный суд, а именно в Буюкань Кишинёвского суда по следующим  
причинам.
В соответствии со ст. 460 (1) УПК, процедура пересмотра начинается на основании 
запроса, адресованного прокурору на уровне суда, рассматривавшего дело по 
существу. При наличии оснований, предусмотренных пунктами 3) и 4) части (3) 
статьи 458, процедура пересмотра начинается на основании обращения в суд, 
рассматривавший дело в первой инстанции.
По перечисленным причинам, учитывая, что заявитель  не желает рассматривать  
дела о нарушении, но настаивает на пересмотре приговора 08.11.200 06 , принятого  
Рышкановка
 муниципальным судом. Кишинёв, суд считает необходимым подать жалобу  
в суд Кишинёва к обычному судье сектор Буюкань.
В соответствии со ст. 342, 460 УПК РМ, суд
Постановляет
Подать
 свою просьбу о  пересмотре приговора 08.11.2 0006, принятого  Рышкановка  
судом. Кишинёв признал себя виновным в совершении преступления,  
предусмотренного
 статьёй 5 Кодекса. 217(2) УК РМ и 219(1)(1961) УК  РМ, 84 УК 
окончательно 5 лет лишения свободы условно один год, в пользу обычного суда,  а 
именно Буюкань место суда Кишинева.
Заключение справом обжалования втечение 15дней .

Instanţa compusă din:
Preşedintele şedinţei,
Judecător 
Grefier
Cu participarea: revizuentului Maceret Alexei 
Translatorului Penov Serghei
a examinat în şedinţă publică cererea de revizuire depusă de Maceret Alexei împotriva istoriei 
sale penale pe perioada anilor 2006-2008
cauza redistribuită la 08.11.2019
Constată
Maceret Alexei la 25.04.2019 a depus o cerere în instanţa de judecată despre revizuirea cauzelor 
penale pe perioada 2006-2018.
în motivarea poziţiei sale s-a referit la faptul că a fost judecat ilegal în baza art. 217(2) CP şi 
219(1) CP(1961), în situaţia în care tot în aceiaşi perioadă a fost sancţionat contravenţional pentru 
aceleaşi fapte în cauzele contravenţionale 4b-824/2006 şi 4b-1409/2006 din 07.11.2006.
în şedinţa de judecată revizuentul Maceret Alexei şi-a reconfirmat poziţia şi a precizat că doreşte 
revizuirea sentinţei de condamnare a judecătoriei Rîşcani mun. Chişinău din 08.11.2006 prin care 
Maceret a fost recunoscut vinovat în comiterea infracţiunii prevăzute de art. 217/2. 219(1) 
CP(1961), definitiv 5 ani închisoare cu aispendare pe un termen de unu ani.
Suplimentar Maceret Alexei a indicat că nu doreşte revizuirea cauzelor contravenţionale 4b- 
824/2006 şi 4b-l409/2006 din 07.11.2006.
Audiind partea, studiind materialele dosarului, instanţa consideră necesar de a transfera 
plângerea la instanţa competentă şi anume la sediul Buiucani al judecătoriei Chişinău din 
următoarele considerente.
în conformitate cu art. 460(1 )CPP, procedura de revizuire se deschide în baza cererii adresate 
procurorului de nivelul instanţei care a judecat cauza în fond. în cazul temeiurilor prevăzute la 
art.458 alin.(3) pct3) şi 4), procedura de revizuire se deschide în baza cererii adresate instanţei de 
judecată care a judecat cauza în primă instanţă.
Din considerentele enumerate, ţinând cont că Maceret Alexei nu doreşte revizuirea cauzelor 
contravenţionale dar insistă la revizuirea sentinţei din 08.11.20006 adoptată de Judecătoria Rîşcani 
mun. Chişinău, instanţa consideră necesar a remite plângerea revizuentului către judecătorul de 
drept comun din cadrul sediului Buiucani a judecătoriei Chişinău.
în conformitate cu art. 342, 460 CPP, instanţa
Dispune
A remite cererea lui Maceret Alexei de revizuire a sentinţei din 08.11.20006 adoptată de 
Judecătoria Rîşcani mun. Chişinău prin care Maceret Alexei a fost recunoscut vinovat în comiterea 
infracţiunii prevăzute de art. 217(2) şi 219(1) CP, prin 84 CP definitiv 5 ani închisoare cu 
suspendare unu ani, în favoarea instanţei de drept comun şi anume sediului Buiucani amun. Chişinău
