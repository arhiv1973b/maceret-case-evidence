Petition for inclusion of evidence - 2 verdicts
Dear court in the framework of sufficient - if only used - principle - presumption
innocence - but due to the absent decisions of sentences dated 05.25.2006 and 07.11.2006
years, but only certificates - which only claim that the punishment was executed and
really coincidences of dates and place - conditionally coincide, as well as the invariability of the situation

The main thing that prosecutors referred to was the absence of the definitions and sentences themselves -
except - submitted from 08.11.2006 - which refers in more detail - to
Circumstances than - certificates of 05.25.2006.
Nevertheless, in the verdict itself, which Macheret was able to familiarize himself with for the first time
only on October 12, 2020, and the decision itself in 2019 was due to a fire.
To begin with, the circumstances - obtaining "evidence" - violate the previously indicated in
application to cancel the sentence dated November 8, 2006 No. 1-989/06 - as having violated articles of the Law
N° 59 - when - such evidence - in form and content - national
legislation - are not accepted and are considered non-existent.
Earlier, in the appeal itself, I described the real reasons that drove my
mother and those who stood in general - behind this “circus”.
I will not again describe these circumstances known to the court.
But circumstances - describe initially that Macher - returned early in the morning, and the police -
Writes at 18-00. Since the mother describes her challenge - it is in the morning - where the aggravating
circumstance - serves - only the drunken state of Macchais, which has a residence permit,

Why was his mother - who was not only not registered - but taken against her will - the main

Why did she change her last name the day before?
In order not to throw - a shadow at the family institution - I will limit myself - that Markov Ivan Mikhailovich - even
was not notified of the trial, like Macheret, for whom the police simply came and took him away - in the morning from

A petition for the introduction of evidence - 2 sentences
Dear Court, within the framework of sufficient - if only used - principle - presumption
innocence - but due to the missing decisions of the verdicts of May 25, 2006 and November 7, 2006
years, but only certificates - which only state that the punishment - was executed and
Indeed, the coincidence of dates and places is conditionally coincident, as is the immutability of the position
Ships from 2006.
The main thing that prosecutors referred to was the absence of the definitions and sentences themselves -
except - submitted from 08.11.2006 - which refers in more detail - to
Circumstances than - certificates of 05.25.2006.
Nevertheless, in the verdict itself, which Macheret was able to familiarize himself with for the first time
only 10/12/2020, and the decision itself in 2019 was due to a fire.
Let's start with the fact that the circumstances - obtaining "evidence" - violate what was previously specified in
Application for the cancellation of the sentence dated 08.11.2006 No. 1-989/06 - as a violation of the Law of the Law
No. 59 - when - such evidence - in form and content - national
legislation - are not accepted and are considered non-existent.
Earlier, I am in the appeal itself - described - the real reasons - moving my
Mother and those who stood at all - behind this "circus".
I will not again describe these circumstances known to the court.
But the circumstances initially describe that Macheret returned early in the morning, and the police -
writes at 18-00. Since the mother describes her call - precisely in the morning - where aggravating
circumstance - serves - only the drunken state of Macchais, which has a residence permit,
yourself on Miron Kostin 13/3 sq. 64 also had property rights.
Why was his mother - who was not only not registered - but taken against her will - the main
the owner - who called the police - about the "introduction" of his youngest daughter on his
The grandson of Machers the living space - who escaped and later detained by the same CPS - sector
Ryshkanovka - according to the complaint of Ivan Mikhailovich Markov, who was warned not to
I tried - to "get hooked" - to her father and son - indicating that she has an apartment on the street. Doga
30 sq. 38?
Why - she replaced the name on the eve of?
In order not to throw - a shadow at the family institution - I will limit myself - that Markov Ivan Mikhailovich - even
was not notified of the trial, like Macheret, for whom the police simply came and took him away - in the morning from
05.24.2006 and not in the evening and really - applying threat measures and frank torture -
I forced - in the spelling of the "confession" - about a hand -handed bag directly into his hands.
Which - having already realized what was going against him - I immediately tore it into small pieces.
This is precisely described in the verdict itself. Thus excluding - the question in
application of Resolution No. 79 - on any quantities and pix weighing.
Therefore - a deception - the prosecutor of Andreius - about supposedly "weighing her personally" - just what
Scraps of newspaper paper and flashed garbage?.
The fact that Macheret was initially accused of possession was the reason - data under
torture of testimony, as evidenced by the policeman’s statement: “a policeman can
To be also a witness "and stop fooling", where enough to fool around is the blows on the head
a book and blows to the kidneys and a whole day spent in a cell where a man had previously died from
beatings - and a pool of blood flowing out of the head - covered - with excess bleach?!?
Since - I briefly described the clerking situation - boiled - were taken - were taken -
“indications” - when the next day from 05/25/2006 coincides with the certificate - th
assigning me a punishment - which concerned precisely the “agreement - guilt” - and accordingly
absence of a lawyer and therefore violations of Article 5 and Article 6 of the Convention, if we consider
violation of Article 3 - torture not proven.
Since only violations of Article 6 were alleged and relate to a subsequent violation
Protocol No. 7 Article 4 - punishment for the same act twice - then please accept as
evidence - specified certificates and certificates - from the tax service and the ministry
finance - which were previously indicated and transferred to the court.
Please take into account that this need has arisen in consideration - the case has arisen only
now - opportunities - to declare legal rehabilitation dated 12/04/2020 for which
allotted 6 months
I would like to ask who was the judge on November 7, 2006?
The answer is proven to be correlational - a judge is a highly moral person who
should not only be afraid of his mistakes, but also, if possible, do everything to avoid them
correct.
Such a person or judge turned out to be precisely the judge who put in their places those who
Indeed, he was guilty of the situation - 2006, already in 2007 - indicated - the bureau
Contractors - without letting them - to violate in such an ugly way - the law.
And we see that the composition of the court did not correspond to the definition that was expected from
This court, and the prosecutor, and the delegated "representatives" themselves - the executive bureau.
And the lawyer herself, who the day before Macheret and Oleinik had been challenged, was clearly
the opponent is the accused.
"Delegated" - Bureau - executors, and - "delegated" prosecutor for the purpose
hide - one's personal interest or "participation", or - complicity in a crime
Against the legitimate interests - both Oleinik himself and against justice.
As evidenced by the “recusal” - prosecutor Kalaguryan and the participation of lawyer Barbakari - who
Directly concerned "Divagnis." Judicial - the meeting was supposed to end, only
the arrest of Macchais - became unexpected for all accomplices - proving that the law was on
Macheret side - when the judge “unexpectedly” makes a decision and makes an “unfair” decision
- from the point of view - the "majority" of the accomplices of the process - who believed that the judge will only go
according to the least “resistance”, as “obliged” - to believe them “representatives” - of the authorities
criminal prosecution.
State defender - who had "prepared" - "replican" - where she "asks"
The court - to reduce the quantity - punishment, was forced to: "maintain a position" -
client.
And here from the very beginning of this - Question: who was the judge on November 7, 2006?
Gives the answer Definition:
No. R.A. -83/07 - which more convincingly proves this violation with
attached certificates proving this violation.
