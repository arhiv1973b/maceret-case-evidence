The evolution of case No. 1-984/07 in the case No. 1-137/08 took place in the absence
Macchaet and his IDNP to make a "bizaro of drive" from 10/13/2008.
Makshte and was not from 03/19/2008, where it is really forcibly
delivered - hours after - the most court hearing - forced
sign and show - Judge Yorgova - what Macheret “looks like”. After applying the provisions of Article 361 part 2 letter (c) in 2006 - only this
It was required - for "discharge" and cancellation - old IDNP
-the -tied to receive the first certificate in life - personality as
associated with unlimited registration - Macchais and his property rights.
Thus, the case No. 1-984/07 - Makset was not even represented, in that
parts of how it is - "turned" against the case No. Ra -84 - suddenly "turned" into case No. 1-137/08 and still not received available for
Understanding text.
The only thing is the translated text issued - for the act of Article 16 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the RM -
This translation is the text of the transposition - text - less than one page.
Therefore, as the college will see, deception and speculation are going on - around - printed
text and its translation.
As for the absence of Macchal - in general in a meeting of 19.03.2008 - deception
It consists in the fact that as I pointed out earlier - Macchaet was indeed detained and appraisably brought to the "bride" for Judge Yorkova - after a few
hours - the end of itself - a meeting.
Khalaguryan knows about this perfectly - deceiving collegium - referring - on
the presence - translator in the meeting.
Yes, indeed - why is it needed if Markova - “gave” written testimony - read out and commented on in the Court - by Lyudmila Nanta.
Markov himself was not there and from him read his own "works" - the same L.
Nanta.
Markov - did not even suspect a trial of his grandson - Machas - and if
I found out I could not speak - since he would have to - to "run" out of -
Psychiatric Department No. 40 - pos. Codra forcibly placed
"Witness" Zina from apartment No. 65 and by "order" by L. Nanta.
Zina also owned the state. language - and the impression was created - that the prosecutor -
Right! What was the only thing that explained - the Interpreter in the Court - Macheret. But this deception - is torn apart - simply - the only one of those present -
did not speak the language - this was the daughter of Markov - Lyudmila Nanta - in girlishness
Markova.
She, being a mother - two nationalists - brought up in the spirit of hatred of
the nationality of his mother - Georgiy and Sergei Nantoy - and raised to hide
The nationality of his mother, as something shameful - their father - OAZ Nanta.
It’s unnecessary to say - who “inspired” Lyudmila Nanta - to his premises
father in a psychiatric hospital and the robbery of his brother Shurin - and
nephew - Macchaet - for the "independent" candidate ". Vulnerability from
Others compensated for - "faithful" wife.
Such a "monument" - it would be possible to put it - if already - this year - not
The murder of his sister - for the "threat" exposure "and" requirements "to rehabilitate the son of Markova - Macchaet
That is why both are OAZu and Lyudmila - the killers and the witness to that and
Oleinik - require rehabilitation.
There are enough grounds for this - in relation to the crime first with
manipulations with the IDNP - ending murder - mother Markova
Galina - criminal cases have been instituted.
I ask the collegium - make the right decision.
So yesterday - tightening the process - artificially supported -
nationalist - caused the death of Markova - tomorrow - not even necessary
Speak - who.
To lose these people is nothing.
I ask you to follow the rule of law.
I won’t ask for what is already clear.
The evolution of the case had - "roots" - not in the "deeds" of the incriminated Machals and
Oleinik, and against Macchaet and Oleinik - crimes of those who believe - rights and
Freedoms of others are nothing.
This is a terrible example. But it must be "exhausted" differently - this is a real threat
Right.
Sincerely, I’ll ask for forgiveness - Ha Building Judge Roybu and Arnaut.
